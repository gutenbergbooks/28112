<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Whether</span> the story of Alonzo and
Melissa will generally please, the writer knows not; if, however, he is
not mistaken, it is not unfriendly to religion and to virtue.&mdash;One
thing was aimed to be shown, that a firm reliance on Providence, however
the affections might be at war with its dispensations, is the only
source of consolation in the gloomy hours of affliction; and that
generally such dependence, though crossed by difficulties and
perplexities, will be crowned with victory at last.</p>

<p>It is also believed that the story contains no indecorous stimulants;
nor is it filled with unmeaning and inexplicated incidents sounding upon
the <ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘senses’">sense</ins>, but
imperceptible to the understanding. When anxieties have been excited by
involved and doubtful events, they are afterwards elucidated by the
consequences.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<p>The writer believes that generally he has copied nature. In the
ardent prospects raised in youthful bosoms, the almost consummation of
their wishes, their sudden and unexpected disappointment, the sorrows of
separation, the joyous and unlooked for meeting&mdash;in the poignant
feelings of Alonzo, when, at the grave of Melissa, he poured the
feelings of his anguished soul over her miniature by the “moon’s pale
ray;”<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>when Melissa, sinking on
her knees before her father, was received to his bosom as a beloved
daughter risen from the dead.</p>

<p>If these scenes are not imperfectly drawn, they will not fail to
interest the refined sensibilities of the reader.</p>

</p>

<p>In the time of the late <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">American</ins> revolution, two young gentlemen of Connecticut, who
had formed an indissoluble friendship, graduated at Yale College in
New-Haven: their names were Edgar and Alonzo. Edgar was the son of a
respectable farmer. Alonzo’s father was an eminent merchant. Edgar was
designed for the desk, Alonzo for the bar; but as they were allowed some
vacant time after their graduation before they entered upon their
professional studies, they improved <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘the’">this</ins> interim in mutual, friendly visits, mingling with
select parties in the amusements of the day, and in travelling through
some parts of the United States.</p>

<p>Edgar had a sister who, for some time, had resided with her cousin at
New-London. She was now about to return, and it was designed that Edgar
should go and attend her home. Previous to the day on which he was to
set out, he was unfortunately thrown from his horse, which so much
injured him as to prevent his prosecuting
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
his intended journey: he therefore invited Alonzo to supply his place;
which invitation he readily accepted, and <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ‘at’">on</ins> the day appointed set out for New-London, where he
arrived, delivered his introductory letters to Edgar’s cousin, and was
received with the most friendly politeness.</p>

<p>Melissa, the sister of Edgar, was about sixteen years of age. She was
not what is esteemed a striking beauty, but her appearance was
pleasingly interesting. Her figure was elegant; her aspect was <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘tempered’">attempered</ins> with a
pensive mildness, which in her cheerful moments would light up into
sprightliness and vivacity. Though on first impression, her countenance
was marked by a sweet and thoughtful serenity, yet she eminently
possessed the power&nbsp;to</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Call round her laughing eyes, in playful turns,</p>
<p>The glance that lightens, and the smile that burns.”</p>
</div>

<p>Her mind was adorned with those delicate graces which are the first
ornaments of female excellence. Her manners were graceful without
affectation, and her taste had been properly directed by a suitable
education.</p>

<p>Alonzo was about twenty-one years old; he had been esteemed an
excellent student. His appearance was manly, open and free. His eye
indicated a nobleness of soul; although his aspect was tinged with
melancholy, yet he was naturally cheerful. His disposition was of <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘a’">the</ins> romantic cast;</p>

</div>

<p>It was evening when Alonzo arrived at the house of Edgar’s cousin.
Melissa was at a ball which had been given on a matrimonial occasion in
the town. Her cousin waited on Alonzo to the ball, and introduced him to
Melissa, who received him with politeness. She was dressed in white,
embroidered and spangled with rich silver lace; a&nbsp;silk girdle,
enwrought and tasseled with gold, surrounded her waist; her hair was
unadorned except by a wreath of artificial flowers, studded by a single
diamond.</p>

<p>After the ball closed, they returned to the house of Edgar’s cousin.
Melissa’s partner at the ball was the son of a gentleman of independent
fortune in New-London. He was a gay young man, aged about twenty-five.
His address was easy, his manners rather voluptuous than refined;
confident, but not ungraceful. He led the ton in fashionable circles;
gave taste its zest, and was quite a favorite with the ladies generally.
His name was Beauman.</p>

<p>Edgar’s cousin proposed to detain Alonzo and Melissa a few days, <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">during</del> which time
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
they passed in <ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">was</ins>
visiting select friends and social parties. Beauman was an assiduous
attendant upon Melissa. He came one afternoon to invite her to ride
out;&mdash;she was indisposed and excused herself. At evening she
proposed walking out with her cousin and his lady; but they were
prevented from attending her by unexpected company. Alonzo offered to
accompany her. It was one of those beautiful evenings in the month of
June, when nature in those parts of America is arrayed in her richest
dress. They left the town and walked through fields adjoining the
harbour.&mdash;The moon shone in full lustre, her white beams trembling
upon the glassy main, where skiffs and sails of various descriptions
were passing and repassing. The shores of Long-Island and the other
islands in the harbour, appeared dimly to float among the waves. The air
was adorned with the fragrance of surrounding flowers; the sound of <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">various</ins> instrumental music
wafted from the town, rendered sweeter by distance, while the
whippoorwill’s sprightly song echoed along the adjacent groves. Far in
the eastern horizon hung a pile of brazen clouds, which had passed from
the north, over which, the crinkling red lightning momentarily darted,
and at times, long peals of thunder were faintly heard. They walked to a
point of the beach, where stood a large
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
rock whose base was washed by every tide. On this rock they seated
themselves, and enjoyed a while the splendours of the scene&mdash;the
drapery of nature. “To this place, said Melissa, have I taken many a
solitary walk, on such an evening as this, and seated on this rock, have
I experienced more pleasing sensations than I ever received in the most
splendid ball-room.” The idea impressed the mind of Alonzo; it was
congenial with the feeling of his soul.</p>

<p>They returned at a late hour, and the next day set out for home.
Beauman handed Melissa into the carriage, and he, with Edgar’s cousin
and his lady, attended them on their first day’s journey. They put up at
night at the house of an acquaintance in Branford. The next morning they
parted; Melissa’s cousin, his lady and Beauman, returned to New-London;
Alonzo and Melissa pursued their journey, and at evening arrived at her
father’s house, which was in the westerly part of the state.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page9" id = "page9"> </a>

<p>Melissa was received with joyful tenderness by her friends. Edgar
soon recovered from his fall, and cheerfulness again assumed its most
pleasing aspect in the family.&mdash;Edgar’s father was a plain
Connecticut farmer. He was rich, and his riches had been acquired by his
diligent attention to business. He had loaned money, and taken
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
mortgages on lands and houses for <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘security’">securities</ins>; and as payment frequently failed, he often
had opportunities of purchasing the involved premises at his own price.
He well knew the worth of a shilling, and how to apply it to its best
use; and in casting interest, he was sure never to lose a farthing. He
had no other children except Edgar and Melissa, on whom he
doated.&mdash;Destitute of literature himself, he had provided the means
of obtaining it for his son, and as he was a rigid presbyterian, he
considered that Edgar could no where figure so well, or gain more
eminence, than in the sacred desk.</p>

<p>The time now arrived when Edgar and Alonzo were to part. The former
repaired to New-York, where he was to enter upon his professional
studies. The latter entered in the office of an eminent attorney in his
native town, which was about twenty miles distant from the village in
which lived the family of Edgar and Melissa. Alonzo was the frequent
guest of this family; for though Edgar was absent, there was still a
charm which attracted him <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘thither’">hither</ins>. If he had admired the manly virtues of the
brother, could he fail to adore the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘sublime’">sublimer</ins> graces of the sister? If all the sympathies of
the most ardent friendship had been drawn forth towards the former, must
not the most
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
tender passions of the soul be attracted by the milder and more refined
excellencies of the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘latter’">other</ins>?</p>

<p>Beauman had become the suitor of Melissa; but the distance of <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">his</ins> residence rendered it
inconvenient to visit her often. He came regularly<ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">, about</ins> once in two or three months; of course
Alonzo and he sometimes met. Beauman had made no serious pretensions,
but his particularity indicated something more than fashionable
politeness.</p>

<p>His manners, his independent situation, his family, entitled him to
respect. “It is not probable therefore that he will be objectionable to
Melissa’s <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘friends--Nor’">friends
or</ins> to Melissa herself,” said Alonzo, with an involuntary sigh.</p>

<p>But as Beauman’s visits to Melissa became more frequent, an
increasing anxiety took place in Alonzo’s bosom. He wished her to remain
single; the idea of losing her by marriage, gave him inexpressible
regret. What substitute could supply the happy hours he had passed in
her company? What charm could wing the lingering moments when she was
gone? In the recess of his studies, he could, in a few hours, be at the
seat of her father: there his cares were dissipated, and the troubles of
life, real or imaginary, on light pinions, fleeted away.&mdash;How
different would be the scene when
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
debarred from the unreserved friendship and conversation of Melissa; And
unreserved it could not be, were she not exclusively mistress of
herself. But was there not something of a more refined texture than
friendship in his predilection for the company of Melissa? If so, why
not avow it? His prospects, his family, and of course his pretensions
might not be inferior to those of Beauman. But perhaps Beauman was
preferred. His opportunities had been greater; he had formed an
acquaintance with her. Distance proved no barrier to his addresses. His
visits became more and more frequent. Was it not <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘highly probable then’">then highly probable</ins> that he
had secured her affections? Thus reasoned Alonzo, but the reasoning
tended not to allay the tempest which was gathering in his bosom. He
ordered his horse, and was in a short time at the seat of Melissa’s
father.</p>

<p>It was summer, and towards evening when he arrived. Melissa was
sitting by the window when he entered the hall. She arose and received
him with a smile. “I&nbsp;have just been thinking of an evening’s walk,
said she, but had no one to attend me, and you have come just in time to
perform that office. I&nbsp;will order tea immediately, while you rest
from the fatigues of your journey.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<p>When tea was served up, a servant entered the room with a letter
which he had found in the yard. Melissa received it.&mdash;“’Tis a
letter, said she, which I sent by Beauman, to a lady in New-London, and
the careless man has lost it.” Turning to Alonzo, “I&nbsp;forgot to tell
you that your friend Beauman has been with us a few days; he left us
this morning.”</p>

<p>“My friend!” replied Alonzo, hastily.</p>

<p>“Is he not your friend?” enquired Melissa.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, madam,” answered he, “my mind was absent.”</p>

<p>“He requested us to present his respects to his friend Alonzo,” said
she. Alonzo bowed and turned the conversation.</p>

<p>They walked out and took a winding path which led along pleasant
fields by a gliding stream, through a little grove and up a sloping
eminence, which commanded an extensive prospect of the surrounding
country; Long Island, <del class = "other"
title = "1804 omits">and</del> the sound between that and the main land, and the
opening <ins class = "change" title = "1811 ‘there off’">thereof</ins>
to the distant ocean.</p>

<p>A soft and silent shower had <ins class = "correction"
title = "; invisible">descended;</ins> a&nbsp;thousand transitory gems trembled
upon the foliage glittering <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘to the’ 1870 ‘in the’">the</ins> western ray.&mdash;A bright rainbow sat
upon <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘the’">a</ins> southern cloud;
the light gales whispered among the branches, agitated the young harvest
to billowy motion, or waved the tops of the distant
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
deep green forest with majestic grandeur. Flocks, herds, and cottages
were scattered over the variegated landscape.</p>

<p>Hills piled on hills, receding, faded from the pursuing eye, mingling
with the blue mist which hovered around the <ins class = "change" title
= "1804 ‘extremest’">extreme</ins> verge of the horizon. “This is a most
<ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘delightful’">beautiful</ins>
scene,” said Melissa.</p>

<p>“It is indeed, replied Alonzo; can New-London boast so charming a
prospect?”</p>

<p>Melissa. No&mdash;yes; indeed I can hardly say. You know, Alonzo, how
I am charmed with the rock at the point of the beach.</p>

<p>Alonzo. You told me <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">of</del> the happy hours you had passed at that place. Perhaps
the company which attended you there, gave the scenery its highest
embellishment.</p>

<p>Melissa. I know not how it happened; but you are the only person who
ever attended me there.</p>

<p>Alonzo. That is a little surprising.</p>

<p>Mel. Why surprising?</p>

<p>Al. Where was Beauman?</p>

<p>Mel. Perhaps he was not fond of solitude. Besides he was not always
my <ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘beau-man’">Beauman</ins>.</p>

<p>Al. Sometimes.</p>

<p>Mel. Yes, sometimes.</p>

<p>Al. And now always.</p>

<p>Mel. Not this evening.</p>

<p>Al. He <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11/70 ‘formally addresses you’">formerly</ins>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<p>Mel. Well.</p>

<p>Al. And will soon claim the exclusive privilege so to do.</p>

<p>Mel. That does not follow of course.</p>

<p>Al. Of course, if his intentions are sincere, and the wishes of
another should accord therewith.</p>

<p>Mel. Who am I to understand by another?</p>

<p>Al. Melissa. [A pause <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">ensued</del>.]</p>

<p>Mel. See that ship, Alonzo, coming up the sound; how she ploughs
through the white foam, while the breezes flutter among the sails,
varying with the beams of the sun.</p>

<p>Al. Yes, it is almost down.</p>

<p>Mel. What is almost down?</p>

<p>Al. The sun. Was not you speaking of the sun, madam?</p>

<p>Mel. Your mind is absent, Alonzo; I was speaking of yonder ship.</p>

<p>Al. I beg <ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">your</ins> pardon,
madam. O yes&mdash;the ship&mdash;it&mdash;it bounds with rapid motion
over the waves.</p>

<p>A pause ensued. They walked leisurely around the hill, and moved
toward home. The sun sunk behind the western hills.&mdash;Twilight arose
in the east, and floated along the air. Darkness began to hover around
the woodlands and vallies. The beauties of the landscape slowly receded.
“This reminds me of our walk at New-London,”
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
said Melissa. “Do you remember it?” enquired Alonzo. “Certainly I do,”
she replied, “I&nbsp;shall never forget the sweet pensive scenery of my
favourite rock.” “Nor I neither,” said Alonzo with a deep drawn
sigh.</p>

<p>The next day Alonzo returned to his studies; but, different from his
former visits to Melissa, instead of exhilarating his spirits, this had
tended to depress them. He doubted whether Melissa was not already
engaged to Beauman. His hopes would persuade him that this was not the
case; but his fears declared <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘otherways’">otherwise</ins>.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>

<p>It was some time before Alonzo renewed his visit. In the interim he
received a letter from a friend in the neighbourhood of Melissa’s
father; an extract from which follows:</p>

<p>“We are soon to have a wedding here; you are acquainted with the
parties&mdash;Melissa D<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
Beauman. Such at least is our opinion from appearances, as Beauman is
now here more than half his time.&mdash;You will undoubtedly be a guest.
We had expected that you would have put in your claims, from your
particular attention to the lady. She is a fine girl, Alonzo.”</p>

<p>“I shall never be a guest at Melissa’s wedding,” said Alonzo, as he
hastily <ins class = "change" title = "1811 ‘passed’">paced</ins> the
room; “but I must once again see her before that event takes place, when
I lose
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
her forever.” The next day he repaired to her father’s. He enquired for
Melissa; she was gone with a party to the shores of the sound, attended
by Beauman. At evening they returned. Beauman and Alonzo addressed each
other with much seeming cordiality. “You have deceived us, Alonzo, said
Melissa. We concluded you had forgotten the road to this place.”</p>

<p>“Was not that a hasty conclusion <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">madam</ins>?” replied Alonzo. “I&nbsp;think not, she answered,
if your long absence should be construed into neglect. But we will hear
your excuse said she, smiling, by and by, and perhaps pardon you.” He
thanked her for her condescension.</p>

<p>The next morning Beauman set out for New-London. Alonzo observed that
he took a tender leave of Melissa, telling her, in a low voice, that he
should have the happiness of seeing her again within two or three weeks.
After he was gone, as Melissa and Alonzo were sitting in a room alone,
“Well <ins class = "other" title = "1804/11">sir</ins>, said she, am I
to hear your excuses?”</p>

<p>Alonzo. For what, madam?</p>

<p>Mel. For neglecting your friends.</p>

<p>Alonzo. I hope it is not so considered, madam.</p>

<p>Mel. Seriously, then, why have you
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
stayed away so long? Has this place no charms in the absence of my
brother?</p>

<p>Al. Would my presence have added to your <ins class = "change" title
= "1870 ‘felicity’">felicities</ins>, Melissa?</p>

<p>Mel. You never came an unwelcome visiter here.</p>

<p>Al. Perhaps I might be sometimes intrusive.</p>

<p>Mel. What times?</p>

<p>Al. When Beauman is your guest.</p>

<p>Mel. I have supposed you were on friendly terms.</p>

<p>Al. We are.</p>

<p>Mel. Why then intrusive?</p>

<p>Al. There are seasons when friendship must yield <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">its pretensions</del> to a superior claim.</p>

<p>Mel. Perhaps I do not rightly comprehend the force of that
remark.</p>

<p>Al. <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘Were’">Was</ins> Beauman
here, my position might be demonstrated.</p>

<p>Mel. I think I understand you.</p>

<p>Al. And acknowledge my observation to be just?</p>

<p>Mel. (hesitating.) Yes&mdash;I believe I must.</p>

<p>Al. And appropriate?</p>

<p>Melissa was silent<ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing or invisible">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Al. You hesitate, Melissa.</p>

<p>She was <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">still</del>
silent.</p>

<p>Al. Will you, Melissa, answer me one question?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<p>Mel. (confused.) If it be a proper <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ‘one. You’">one you</ins> are entitled to candour.</p>

<p>Al. Are you engaged to Beauman?</p>

<p>Mel. (blushing.) He has asked me the same question concerning
you.</p>

<p>Al. Do you prefer him to any other?</p>

<p>Mel. (deeply blushing, her eyes cast upon the floor.) He has made the
same enquiry respecting you<ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing or invisible">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Al. Has he asked your father’s permission to address you?</p>

<p>Mel. That I have not suffered him yet to do.</p>

<p>Al. Yet!</p>

<p>Mel. I assure you I have not.</p>

<p>Al. (taking her hand with anxiety.) Melissa, I&nbsp;beg you will deal
candidly. I&nbsp;am entitled to no claims, but you know what my heart
would ask. I&nbsp;will bow to your decision. Beauman or Alonzo must
relinquish their pretensions. We cannot share the blessing. <!-- well,
not in this type of book anyway :-) --></p>

<p>Mel. (her cheeks suffused with a varying glow, her lips pale, her
voice <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘trembles’">tremulous</ins>,
her eyes still cast down.) My parents have informed me that it is
improper to receive the particular <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ‘address’">addresses</ins> of more than one. I&nbsp;am conscious of my
inadvertency, and that the reproof is just. One therefore must be
dismissed. But&mdash;(she <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘blushed’">hesitated</ins>.)</p>

<p>A considerable pause <ins class = "correction"
title = "‘s’ invisible">ensued</ins>. At length
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
Alonzo arose&mdash;“I will not press you farther,” said he; “I&nbsp;know
the delicacy of your feeling, I&nbsp;know your sincerity; I&nbsp;will
not therefore insist on your performing the painful task of deciding
against me. Your conduct in every point of view has been discreet.
I&nbsp;could have no just claims, or if I had, your heart must sanction
them, or they would be unhallowed and unjustifiable. I&nbsp;shall ever
pray for your felicity.&mdash;Our affections are not under our
direction; our happiness depends on our obedience to their mandates.
Whatever, then, may be my sufferings, you are unblameable and
irreproachable.” He took his hat in extreme agitation, and prepared to
take his leave.</p>

<p>Melissa had recovered in some degree from her embarrassment, and
collected her scattered spirits. “Your conduct, Alonzo, said she, is
generous and noble. Will you give yourself the trouble, and do me the
honour to see me once more?” “I&nbsp;will, said he, at any time you
shall appoint.”&mdash;“Four weeks then, she said, from this day, honour
me with a visit, and you shall have my decision, and receive my final
answer.” “I&nbsp;will be punctual to the day,” he replied, and bade her
adieu.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>

<p>Alonzo’s hours now winged heavily away. His wonted cheerfulness fled;
he wooed the silent and solitary haunts of “musing, moping
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
melancholy.” He loved to wander through lonely fields, or along the
verge of some lingering stream, “when dewy twilight rob’d the evening
mild,” or “to trace the forest glen, through which the moon darted <ins
class = "change" title = "1811 ‘his’">her</ins> silvery intercepted
ray.”</p>

<p>He was fondly indulging a tender passion which preyed upon his peace,
and deeply disturbed his repose. He looked anxiously to the hour when
Melissa was to make her decision. He wished, yet dreaded the event. In
that he foresaw, or thought he foresaw, a&nbsp;withering blight to his
budding hopes, and a final consummation to his foreboding fears. He had
pressed Melissa, perhaps too urgently, to a declaration.&mdash;Had her
predilection been in his favour, would she have hesitated to avow it?
Her parents had advised her to relinquish, and had permitted her to
retain one suitor, nor had they attempted to influence or <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘forestal’">direct</ins> her choice. Was it not
evident, then, from her confused hesitation and embarrassment, when
solicited to discriminate upon the subject, that her ultimate decision
would be in favour of Beauman?</p>

<p>While Alonzo’s mind was thus agitated, he received a second letter
from his friend in the neighbourhood of Melissa. He read the following
clause therein with <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ‘emotion’">emotions</ins> more easily <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">to be</del> conceived than expressed:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<p>“Melissa’s wedding day is appointed. I need not tell you that Beauman
is to be the happy deity of the hymeneal sacrifice. I&nbsp;had this from
his own declaration. He did not name the positive day, but it is
certainly to be soon. You will undoubtedly, however, have timely notice,
as a guest. We must pour <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">out</ins> a liberal libation <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘to’">upon</ins> the mystic altar, Alonzo, and twine the nuptial garland
with wreaths of joy. Beauman ought to devote a rich offering to so
valuable a prize. He has been here for a week, and departed for
New-London yesterday, but is shortly to return.”</p>

<p>“And why have I <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">ever</del>
doubted this event? said Alonzo. What infatuation hath thus led me on
<ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">to</ins> the pursuit of
fantastic and unreal bliss? I&nbsp;have had, it is true, no positive
assurance that Melissa would favour my addresses. But why did she ever
receive them? Why did she enchantingly smile upon me? Why fascinate the
tender powers of my soul by that winning mildness, and the favourable
display of those complicated and superior attractions which she must
have known were irresistible?&mdash;Why did she not spurn me from her
confidence, and plainly tell me that my attentions were untimely and
improper? And now she would have me dance attendance to her decision in
favour of Beauman&mdash;Insulting! Let Beauman
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
and she make, as they have formed, this farcical decision;
I&nbsp;absolutely will never attend it.&mdash;But stop: I&nbsp;have
engaged to see her at an appointed time; my honour is therefore pledged
for an interview; it must take place. I&nbsp;shall support it with
becoming dignity, and <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">I</del>
will convince <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">both</ins>
Melissa and Beauman that I am not the dupe of their caprices. But let me
consider&mdash;What has Melissa done to deserve censure or reproach? Her
brother was my early friend: she has treated me as a friend to her
brother. <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">She was the
unsuspecting object of my passion.</ins> She was unconscious of the
flame which her charms had kindled in my bosom.&mdash;Her evident
embarrassment and confusion on receiving my declaration, witnessed her
surprise and prior attachment. What could she do? To save herself the
pain of a direct denial, she <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’has’">had</ins> appointed a day when her refusal may come in a more
delicate and formal manner&mdash;and I must meet&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>At the appointed day, Alonzo proceeded to the house of Melissa’s
father, where he arrived late in the afternoon. Melissa had retired to a
little summer house at the end of the garden; a&nbsp;servant conducted
Alonzo thither. She was dressed in a flowing robe of white muslin,
embroidered with a deep fringe lace. Her hair hung loosely upon her
shoulders; she was contemplating a bouquet of flowers which she held in
her
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
hand. Alonzo fancied she never appeared so lovely. She arose to receive
him. “We have been expecting you some time, said Melissa; we <ins class
= "change" title = "1870 ’are’">were</ins> anxious to inform you, that
we have just received a letter from my brother, in which he desires us
to present you his most friendly respects, and complains of your not
writing to him lately so frequently as usual.” Alonzo thanked her for
the information; said that business <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">had</ins> prevented him; he esteemed him as his most <ins
class = "change" title = "1804/11 ’valued’">valuable</ins> friend, and
would be more particular in future.</p>

<p>“We have been thronged with company for several days, said Melissa.
Once a year my father celebrates his birth day, when we are honoured
with so numerous a company of uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews and
nieces, that were you present, you would suppose we were connected with
half the families in Connecticut. The last of this company took their
departure yesterday, and I have only to regret, that I have for nearly a
week, been prevented from visiting my favourite hill, to which you
attended me when you <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’last was’">was
last</ins> here. It is much improved since then: I&nbsp;have had a
little arbour built under the large tree on its summit: you will have no
objection to view it, Alonzo?” He assured her he accepted the invitation
with pleasure,
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
and towards evening they resorted to the place and seated themselves in
the arbour.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of autumn, and a yellow hue was spread over the
fading charms of nature. The withering forest began to shed its decaying
foliage, which the light gales pursued along the russet fields. The low
sun extended the lengthening shadows; <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">the</ins> curling smoke ascended from the surrounding cottages.
A&nbsp;thick fog crept along the vallies; a&nbsp;gray mist hovered over
the tops of the mountains. The glassy surface of the sound glittered to
the sun’s departing ray. The solemn herds lowed in <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’solemn’">monotonous</ins> symphony. The autumnal insects
in sympathetic <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’wailings’ 1811 ‘waftings’">wafting</ins>, plaintively predicted their approaching fate.
“The scene is changed since we last visited this place, said Melissa;
the gay charms of summer are beginning to decay, and must soon yield
their splendors to the <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">rude</del> despoiling hand of winter.”</p>

<p>“That will be the case, said Alonzo, before I shall have the pleasure
of your company here again.”</p>

<p>Mel. That probably may be, though it is nearly two months yet to
winter.</p>

<p>Al. Great changes may take place within that time.</p>

<p>Mel. Yes, changes must take place; but
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
nothing, I&nbsp;hope, to embitter present prospects.</p>

<p>Al. (peevishly.) As it respects yourself, I&nbsp;trust not,
madam.</p>

<p>Mel. (tenderly.) And I sincerely hope not, as it respects you,
Alonzo.</p>

<p>Al. That wish, I believe, is vain.</p>

<p>Mel. Why so ominous a prediction?</p>

<p>Al. The premises, from which it is drawn, are correct.</p>

<p>Mel. Your feelings accord with the season, Alonzo; you are <ins class
= "correction" title = ". invisible">melancholy.</ins> Shall we
return?</p>

<p>Al. I ask your pardon, madam; I know I am unsociable. You speak of
returning: You know the occasion of my being here.</p>

<p>Mel. For the purpose of visiting your friends, I&nbsp;presume.</p>

<p>Al. And no other?</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>Al. You cannot have forgotten your own appointment, and consequent
engagement?</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>Al. I know, Melissa, that you are incapable of duplicity or <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ’evasions’">evasion</ins>. I&nbsp;have
promised, and now repeat the declaration, that I will silently submit to
your decision. This you have engaged to make, and this is the time you
have appointed. The pains of present suspense can scarcely be surpassed
by the pangs of disappointment. On your part
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
you have nothing to fear. I&nbsp;trust you have candidly determined, and
will decide explicitly.</p>

<p>Mel. (sighing.) I am placed in an exceedingly delicate situation.</p>

<p>Al. I know you are; but your own honour, your own peace, require that
you should extricate yourself from the perplexing embarrassment.</p>

<p>Mel. I am sensible they do. It must&mdash;it shall be done.</p>

<p>Al. And the sooner it is done the better.</p>

<p>Mel. That I am convinced of. I now know that I have been
inadvertently indiscreet. I&nbsp;have admitted the addresses of Beauman
and yourself, without calculating or expecting the consequences. You
have both treated me honourably, and with respect. You are both on equal
grounds as to your character and standing in life. With Beauman I became
first acquainted. As it relates to him, some new arrangements have taken
place since you were here, which<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Al. (interrupting her, with emotion.) Of those arrangements I am
acquainted.</p>

<p>Mel. (surprised.) By what means were you informed thereof?</p>

<p>Al. I received it from a friend in your neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A considerable pause ensued.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<p>Al. You see, Melissa, I am prepared for the event.&mdash;She was <ins
class = "other" title = "1804/11">still</ins> silent.</p>

<p>Al. I have mentioned before, that, whatever be your decision, no
impropriety can attach to you. I&nbsp;might not, indeed, from various
circumstances, and from the information I possess, I&nbsp;perhaps should
not, have given you farther trouble on the occasion, had it not been
from your own direction and appointment. And I am now willing to retire
without further explanation, without giving you the pain of an express
decision, if you think the measure expedient. Your declaration can only
be a matter of form, the consequence of which I know, and my proposition
may save your feelings.</p>

<p>Mel. No, Alonzo; my reputation depends on my adherence to my first
determination; justice to yourself and to Beauman also <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ’demands’">demand</ins> it. After what has
passed, I&nbsp;should be considered as acting capriciously and
inconsistently, should I depart from it. Beauman will be here to-morrow,
and<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Al. To-morrow, madam?</p>

<p>Mel. He will be here to-morrow, and you must consent to stay with us
until that time; the matter shall then be decided.</p>

<p>Al. I&mdash;yes&mdash;it shall be as you say, madam. Make your
arrangements as you please.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<p>Evening had now spread her dusky mantle over the face of nature. The
stars glistened in the sky. The breeze’s rustling wing was in the tree.
The “<ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’stilly’ 1870 ‘distant’">slitty</ins> sound” of the low murmuring brook, and the far
off water-fall, were faintly heard. The twinkling fire-fly arose from
the surrounding verdure and illuminated the air with a thousand
transient gleams. The mingling discordance of curs and watch-dogs echoed
in the distant village, from whence the frequent lights darted their
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’paly’ 1870 ’pale’">palely</ins>
lustre thro’ the gloom. The solitary whippoorwills stationed themselves
along the woody glens, the groves and rocky pastures, and <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ’sang’">sung</ins> a requiem to departed summer.
A&nbsp;dark cloud was rising in the west, across whose gloomy front the
vivid lightning bent its forky spires.</p>

<p>Alonzo and Melissa moved slowly to the village; she appeared
enraptured with the melancholy splendours of the evening, but <ins class
= "change" title = "1804 ’other subjects’">the other subject</ins>
engaged the mental attention of Alonzo.</p>

<p>Beauman arrived the next day. He gave his hand to Alonzo with <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">the</ins> seeming warmth of
friendship. If it was reciprocated, it must have been affected. There
was no alteration in the manners and conversation of Melissa: her
conversation, as usual, was sprightly and interesting. After dinner she
retired, and her father requested Alonzo
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
and Beauman to withdraw with him to a private room. After they were
seated, the old <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘gentlemen’">gentleman</ins> thus addressed them:</p>

<p>“I have called you here, gentlemen, to perform my duty as a parent to
my daughter, and as a friend to you. You are both suitors to Melissa;
while your addresses were merely formal, they were innocent; but when
they became serious they were dangerous. Your pretensions I consider
equal, and between honourable pretenders, who are worthy of my daughter,
I&nbsp;shall not attempt to influence her choice. That choice, however,
can rest only on one: she has engaged to decide between you. I&nbsp;am
come to make, in her name, this decision. The following are my
terms:&mdash;No quarrel or difficulty shall arise between you,
gentlemen, in consequence of her determination. Nothing shall go abroad
respecting the affair; it shall be ended under my roof. As soon as I
have pronounced her declaration, you shall both depart and absent my
house for at least two weeks, as it would be improper for my daughter to
see either of you at present: after that period I shall be happy to
receive your visits.”&mdash;Alonzo and Beauman pledged their honour to
abide <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’explicitly’">implicitly</ins> <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’to’">by</ins> these injunctions. Her father then observed&mdash;“This,
gentlemen, is all I require. I&nbsp;have observed that I considered
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
your pretensions equal: so has my daughter treated them. You have both
made professions to her; she has appointed a time to answer you. That
time has <ins class = "other" title = "1804/11">now</ins> arrived, and I
now inform you that she has decided in favour of&mdash;Alonzo.”</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>

<p>The declaration of Melissa’s father burst upon the mental powers of
Beauman, like a sudden and tremendous clap of thunder on the deep and
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘sullen’">solemn</ins> silence of
night. Unaccustomed to disappointment, he had calculated on success. His
addresses to the ladies had ever been honourably received.</p>

<p>Melissa was the first whose charms were capable of rendering them
sincere. He was not ignorant of Alonzo’s attention to her: it gave him
however but little uneasiness. He believed that his superior
qualifications would eclipse the pretensions of his rival. He considered
himself a connoisseur in character, especially in the character of the
ladies. He conformed to their taste; he flattered their foibles, and
obsequiously bowed to the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’minutiae’">minutia</ins> of female volatility. He considered himself
skilled in the language of the heart; and he trusted <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">that</del> from his pre-eminent powers in
the science of affection, he had only to see, to sue and to conquer. He
had frankly offered his hand to Melissa, and pressed her for a decisive
answer. This from time to time she suspended,
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
and finally appointed a day to give <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">both</ins> him and Alonzo a determinate answer, though neither
knew the arrangements made with the other.</p>

<p>Finding, however, the dilemma in which she was placed, she had
previously consulted her parents. Her father had no objection to her
choosing between two persons of equal claims to affluence and
reputation; this choice she had made, and her father was considered the
most proper person to pronounce&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>When Beauman had urged his suit to Melissa, he supposed that her <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ’hesitation’">hesitations</ins>, delays
and suspensions, were only the effects of maiden diffidence and
timidity. He had no suspicions of her ultimately rejecting it; and when
she finally named the day of decision, he was confident <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">that</ins> she would decide in his favour.
These sentiments he had communicated to the person who had written to
Alonzo, intimating that Melissa had fixed a time which was to crown his
happiest wishes.</p>

<p>He had listened therefore attentively to the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’word’">words</ins> of Melissa’s father, momentarily
expecting to hear himself declared the favourite choice of the fair.</p>

<p>What then must have been his disappointment when the name of Alonzo
was pronounced instead of his own! The highly finished
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
scene of pleasure and future prosperity which his ardent imagination had
depicted, had vanished in a moment. The rainbow glories which gilded his
youthful horizon, had faded in an instant&mdash;the bright sun of his
early hopes had set in mournful darkness. The summons of death would not
have been more unexpected, or more shocking to his imagination.</p>

<p>Very different were the sensations which inspired the bosom of
Alonzo. He had not even calculated on a decision in his own favour. He
believed that Beauman would be the choice of Melissa. She had told him
that the form of decision was necessary to save appearances: with this
form he complied because she desired it, not because he expected the
result would be in his favour. He had not therefore attended to the
words of Melissa’s father with that eagerness which favourable
anticipations commonly produce. But when his name was mentioned; when he
found he was the choice&mdash;the happy favourite of Melissa’s
affection, every tender passion of his soul became interested, and was
suddenly aroused to the refinements of sensibility. Like an electric
shock, it reanimated his whole frame, and vibrated every nerve of his
heart. The glooms which hung about his mind were dissipated, and
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
the bright morning of joy broke in upon his soul.</p>

<p>Thus were the expectations of Alonzo and Beauman
disappointed&mdash;how differently, the sequel has shown.</p>

<p>Melissa’s father retired immediately after pronouncing the
declaration; the two young gentlemen also soon after withdrew. Alonzo
saw the tempest which tore the bosom of his rival, and he pitied him
from his heart.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed, and Alonzo felt all that anxiety and impatience
which a separation from a beloved object can produce. He framed a
thousand excuses to visit Melissa, yet he feared a visit might be
premature. He was, however, necessitated to make a journey <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ’into a different’">to a distant</ins> part of
the country, after which he resolved to see Melissa. He performed his
business, and was returning. It was toward evening, and the day had been
uncommonly sultry for the autumnal season. A&nbsp;rising shower
blackened the western hemisphere; <!-- all of it?! --> the dark vapour
ascended in folding ridges, and the thunder rolled at a distance. Alonzo
saw he should be overtaken. He discovered an elegant seat about one
hundred yards distant from the road; thither he <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’hasted’">hastened</ins> to gain shelter from the
approaching storm. The owner of the mansion met him at the door,
politely invited him to alight and walk in,
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
while a servant stood ready to take his horse. He was ushered into a
large room neatly furnished, where the family and several young ladies
were sitting. As Alonzo glanced his eyes hastily around the room, he
thought he recognized a familiar countenance. A&nbsp;hurried succession
of confused ideas for a moment crossed his recollection. In a moment<ins
class = "other" title = "1870 only">, however,</ins> he discovered that
it was Melissa. By this unexpected meeting they were both completely
embarrassed. Melissa, however, arose, and in rather a confused manner,
introduced Alonzo, as the classmate of her brother, to the family of Mr.
Simpson and the company.</p>

<p>The rain continued most part of the afternoon. Alonzo was invited,
and consented to stay all night. A&nbsp;moon-light evening succeeded the
shower, which invited the young people to walk in an adjoining garden.
Melissa told Alonzo that Mr. Simpson was a distant relative of her
father; his family consisted of his wife, two amiable daughters, not far
from Melissa’s age, and one son, named William, about seventeen years
old. She had been invited there to pass a week, and expected to return
within two days. And she added, smiling, “perhaps, Alonzo, we may have
an opportunity once more to visit the bower on my prospect hill, before
winter entirely destroys the
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
remaining beauties of <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’Summer’">the
summer</ins>.” Alonzo felt <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">all</del> the force of the remark. He recollected the
conversation when they were last at the place she mentioned; and he well
remembered his feelings on that occasion.</p>

<p>“Great changes, indeed, he replied, have taken place since we were
last there: that they are productive of unexpected and unexampled
happiness to me, is due, Melissa, to you alone.” Alonzo departed the
next morning, appointing the next week to visit Melissa at her father’s
house.</p>

<p>Thus were the obstacles removed which presented a barrier to the
united wishes of Alonzo and Melissa. They had not, it is true, been
separated by wide seas, unfeeling parents, or the rigorous laws of war;
but troubles, vexations, doubts and difficulties, had thus far attended
them, which had now disappeared, and they calculated on no unpropitious
event which might thwart their future union. All the time that Alonzo
could spare from his studies was devoted to Melissa, and their parents
began to calculate on joining their hands as soon as Alonzo’s
professional term of study was completed.</p>

<p>The troubles which gave rise to the disseveration of England from
America had already commenced, which broke out the ensuing spring into
actual hostilities, by the
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
battle <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’of’">at</ins> Lexington,
followed soon after by the battle <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘at Bunker’s’ 1870 ’of Bunker’">at Bunker</ins> Hill. The panic and
general bustle which took place in America on these events, is yet well
remembered by many. They were not calculated to impress the mind of
Melissa with the most pleasing sensations. She foresaw that the burden
of the war must rest on the American youth, and she trembled in
anticipation for the fate of Alonzo. He, with others, should the war
continue, must take the field, in defence of his country. The effects of
such a separation were dubious and gloomy. Alonzo and she frequently
discoursed <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">upon the
subject</ins>, and they agreed to form the mystic union previous to any
wide separation.</p>

<p>One event tended to hasten this resolution. The attorney in whose
office Alonzo was clerk, received a commission in the new raised
American army, and marched to the lines near Boston. His business was
therefore suspended, and Alonzo returned to the house of his father. He
considered that he could not long remain a mere spectator of the
contest, and that it might soon be his duty to take the field; he
therefore concluded it best to hasten his marriage with Melissa. She
consented to the proposition, and their parents made the necessary
arrangements for the event. They had even fixed upon the place which was
to be the
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
future residence of this happy couple. It was a pleasantly situated
village, surrounded by rugged elevations, which gave an air of serenity
and seclusion to the valley they encircled. On the south arose a
spacious hill, which was ascended by a gradual acclivity; its sides and
summit interspersed with orchards, arbours, and <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’cultured’">cultivated</ins> fields. On the west, forests
unevenly lifted their rude heads, with here and there a solitary field,
newly cleared, and thinly scattered with cottages. To the east, the eye
extended over a soil, at one time swelling into craggy elevations, and
at another spreading itself into vales of the most enchanting verdure.
To the north it extended over a vast succession of mountains, wooded to
their summits, and throwing their shadows over intervales of equal
wilderness, till at length it was arrested in its excursions by the blue
mists which hovered over mountains more grand, majestic and lofty.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagA" id = "tagA" href = "#noteA">*</a>
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteA" id = "noteA" href = "#tagA">*</a>
Some who read this description will readily recognize the village here
described.</span>
A&nbsp;rivulet which rushed from the hills, formed a little lake on the
borders of the village, which beautifully reflected the cottages from
its transparent bosom. Amidst a cluster of locusts and weeping willows,
rose the spire of the church, in the ungarnished decency of Sunday
neatness. Fields, gardens, meadows, and pastures
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
were spread around the valley, and <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">on</del> the sides of the declivities, yielding in their season
the rich flowers, fruits and foliage of spring, summer and autumn. The
inhabitants of this modern <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’Avernum’">Auvernum</ins> were mostly farmers. They were mild, sociable,
moral and diligent. The produce of their own flocks and fields gave them
most of their food and clothing. To dissipation they were strangers, and
the luxuries of their tables were few.</p>

<p>Such was the place <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">chosen</ins> for the <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">future</ins> residence of Alonzo and Melissa. They had visited the
spot, and were enraptured with its pensive, romantic beauties.
A&nbsp;site was marked out whereon to erect their family mansion. It was
on a little eminence which sloped gradually to the lake, in the most
pleasant part of the village. “Here, said Alonzo one day to Melissa,
will we pass our days in all that felicity of mind which the chequered
scenes of life admit. In the spring we will rove among the flowers. In
summer, we will gather strawberries in yonder fields, or whortleberries
from the adjacent shrubbery. The breezes of fragrant morning, and the
sighs of the evening gale, will be mingled with the songs of the
thousand various <ins class = "correction"
title = "‘s’ invisible">birds</ins> which frequent the surrounding groves. We will
gather the bending fruits of autumn, and we will listen to the hoarse
voice of
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
winter, its whistling winds, its driving snow, and rattling hail, with
delight.”</p>

<p>The bright gems of joy glistened in the eyes of Melissa. With Alonzo
she anticipated approaching happiness, and her bosom beat in rapturous
unison. <!-- not her heart, just her bosom --></p>

<p>Winter came on; it rapidly passed away. Spring advanced, and the
marriage day was appointed.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>

<p>The spring opened with the din of preparation throughout America for
defensive war. It now was found that vigorous measures must be pursued
to oppose the torrent which was preparing to overwhelm the colonies,
which had now been dissevered from the British empire, by the
declaration of independence. The continental army was now raising, and
great numbers of American youth volunteered in the service of their
country. A&nbsp;large army of reinforcements was soon expected from
England to land on our shores, and “the confused noise of the <ins class
= "change" title = "1804 ’warrior’">warriors</ins>, and garments rolled
in blood,” were already anticipated.</p>

<p>Alonzo had received a commission in a regiment of militia, and was
pressed by several young gentlemen of his acquaintance, who had entered
the army, to join it also. He had an excuse. His father was a man in
extensive business, was considerably past the prime of life, had a
number of agents
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
and clerks under him, but began to grow unable to attend to the various
and burthensome duties and demands of a mercantile life.</p>

<p>Alonzo was his only son; his assistance therefore became necessary
until, at least, his father could bring his business to a close, which
he was now about to effect. Alonzo stated these facts to his friends;
told them that on every occasion he should be ready to fly to the post
of danger when his country was invaded, and that as soon as his father’s
affairs should be settled, he would, if necessary, willingly join the
army.</p>

<p>The day now rapidly approached when Alonzo was to make Melissa his
own. Preparations for the hymeneal ceremony were making, and invitations
had already gone abroad. Edgar, the brother of Melissa, had entered the
army in the capacity of chaplain. He was soon expected home, where he
intended to tarry until the consummation of the nuptials, before he set
out for the camp. Letters recently received from him, informed that he
expected to be at his father’s in three or four days.</p>

<p>About three weeks previous to the appointed marriage day, Alonzo and
Melissa one afternoon rode out to the village which had been chosen for
their future residence. Their carriage stopped at the only inn in the
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
place, and from thence they walked around this modern <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ’Vacluse’">Vaucluse</ins>, charmed with the
secluded beauties of its situation. They passed a little time at the
spot selected for <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’the’">their</ins>
habitation; they projected the structure of the buildings, planned the
gardens, the artificial groves, the walks, the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’meads’">mead</ins>, the fountains, and the green retreat
of the summer house, and they already saw, in anticipation, the various
domestic blessings and felicities with which they were to be
surrounded.</p>

<p>They took tea at the inn, and prepared to return. It was <del class =
"other" title = "1804/11 omit">at</del> the latter end of the month of
May, and nature was adorned in the bridal ornaments of spring; the sun
was sunk behind the groves, which cast <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ’the’">their</ins> sombre shades over the valley, while the
retiring beams of day adorned the distant eastern eminences with yellow
lustre.</p>

<p>The birds sung melodiously in the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’grove’">groves</ins>, the air was freshened by light western breezes,
bearing upon their wings all the entrancing odours of the season. Around
the horizon, <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">electric</del>
clouds raised their brazen summits, based <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ’on’">in</ins> the black vapour of approaching night.</p>

<p>They slowly ascended the hill south of the town, where they paused a
few moments to enjoy the splendours of the evening scene. This hill,
which commanded a
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
prospect of all the surrounding country, the distant sound, and the
adjacent towns and villages, <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">presented to the eye, on a single view,</del> perhaps one of the
most picturesque draperies painted by nature. Alonzo attended Melissa to
her father’s, and the next day returned home.</p>

<p>His father had been absent for three or four days to one of the
commercial seaports, on business with some merchants with whom he was
connected in trade. He returned <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the</del> next day after Alonzo got home:&mdash;his aspect and
his conversation were marked with an assumed and unmeaning cheerfulness.
At supper he ate nothing, discoursed much, but in an unconnected and
hurried manner, interrupted by long pauses, in which he appeared to be
buried in contemplation.</p>

<p>After supper, he asked Alonzo if it were not possible that his
marriage with Melissa could be consummated within a few days. Alonzo,
startled at so unexpected a question, replied, that such a proposal
would be considered extraordinary, perhaps improper: besides, when
Melissa had fixed the day, she mentioned that she had an uncle <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">who lived</del> near Charleston,
<del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">in</del> South Carolina, whose
daughter was to pass the summer with Melissa, and was expected to arrive
before the appointed <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">marriage</ins> day. It <ins class = "correction"
title = ", invisible">would,</ins> he said,
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
be a delicate point for him to request her to anticipate the nuptials,
unless he could give some cogent reasons for so doing; and at present he
was not apprised that any such existed. His father, after a few moments
hesitation, answered, “I&nbsp;have reasons, which, when told”&mdash;here
he stopped, suddenly arose, hastily walked the room in much <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘vissible’">visible</ins> agony of mind, and
then retired to his chamber.</p>

<p>Alonzo and his mother were much amazed at so strange a proceeding.
They could form no conjecture of its cause or its consequence. Alonzo
passed a sleepless night. His father’s slumbers were interrupted. He
would frequently start up in <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the</del> bed, then sink in restless sleep, with incoherent
mutterings, and plaintive moans. In the morning, when he appeared at
breakfast, his countenance wore the marks of dejection and anguish.</p>

<p>He scarcely spoke a word, and after the <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ’cloth’">table</ins> was removed, he ordered all to withdraw
except his wife and Alonzo; when, with emotions that spoke the painful
feelings of his bosom, he thus addressed them:</p>

<p>“For more than forty years I have toiled early and late to acquire
independence and ease for myself and <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">my</del> family. To accomplish this, I&nbsp;became connected with
some English importing merchants in a seaport
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
town, and went largely into the English trade. Success crowned our
endeavours; on balancing our accounts two years ago, we found that our
expectations were answered, and that we were now sufficiently wealthy to
close business, which some proposed to do; it was, however, agreed to
make one effort more, as some favourable circumstances appeared to
offer, in which we adventured very largely, on a fair calculation of
liberal and extensive proceeds.</p>

<p>“Before returns could be made, the war came on, embarrassments
ensued, and by indubitable intelligence lately received, we find that
our property in England has been sequestered; five of our ships, laden
with English goods, lying in English harbours, and just ready to sail
for America, have been seized as lawful prizes. Added to this, three
vessels from the <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’indies’">Indies</ins>, laden with <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’Island’">island</ins> produce, have been taken on their homeward bound
voyage, and one lost on her return from Holland. This wreck of fortune I
might have survived, had I to sustain only my equal dividend of the
loss: but of the merchants with whom I have been connected, not one
remains to share the fate of the event; all have absconded or secreted
themselves. To attempt to compound with my creditors would be of little
avail; my whole fortune will not pay one fourth
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
of the debts; so that, compound or not, the consequence to me is
inevitable ruin.</p>

<p>“To abscond would not secure me, as most of my remaining property is
vested in real estate. And even if it would, I&nbsp;could not consent to
it: I&nbsp;could not consent to banish myself from my country; to flee
like a felon; to skulk from society with the base view of defrauding my
creditors. No, I&nbsp;have lived honestly, and honestly will I die. By
fair application and long industry my wealth has been obtained; and it
shall never justly be said, that the reputation of my latter days was
stained with acts of baseness <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">and meanness</del>. I&nbsp;have notified and procured a meeting
of the creditors, and have laid the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’matter’">matters</ins> before them. Some appeared favourable to me;
others insinuated that we were all connected in fraudulent designs, to
swindle our creditors. This I repelled with becoming spirit, and was in
consequence threatened with immediate prosecution. Whatever may be the
event, I&nbsp;had some hopes that your happiness, Alonzo, might <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">yet</del> be secured. Hence I
proposed your union with Melissa, before our misfortunes should be
promulgated. Your parents are old; a&nbsp;little will serve the residue
of their days. With your acquirements you may make your way in life.
I&nbsp;shall have no property to give you; but I would
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
still wish you to secure that which you prize far above, and without
which, both honours and emoluments are unimportant and worthless.”</p>

<p>At this moment a loud rap at the door interrupted the discourse, and
three men were ushered in, which proved to be the sheriff and his
attendants, sent by the more inexorable creditors of Alonzo’s father and
company, to level on the property of the former, which orders they
faithfully executed, by seizing the lands, tenements and furniture, and
finally arresting the body of the old gentleman, which was soon released
by his friendly neighbours becoming bail for his appearance; but the
property was soon after sold at public vendue, at less than half its
value, and Alonzo’s father and mother were compelled to abandon the
premises, and take shelter in a little hut, belonging to a neighbouring
farmer, illy and temporarily furnished by the gratuitous liberality of a
few friends.</p>

<p>We <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’would’">will</ins> not stop
the reader to moralize on this disastrous event. The feelings of the
family can better be conceived than detailed. <!-- yeah, you wouldn’t
want to WRITE them out or anything --> Hurled in a moment from the lofty
summit of affluence to the low and barren vale of poverty! Philosophy
came to the aid of the parents, but who can realise the feelings of the
son! Thus suddenly cut
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
short of his prospects, not only of future independence, but even of
support, what would be the event of his suit to Melissa, and stipulated
marriage? Was it not probable that her father would now cancel the
contract? Could she consent to be his wife in his present penurious
situation?&mdash;And indeed, could he himself consent to make her his
wife, to make her miserable?</p>

<p>In this agitated frame of mind he received a letter from his friend
in Melissa’s neighbourhood, requesting him to come immediately to his
house, whither he repaired the following day. This person had ever been
the unchanging friend of Alonzo; he had heard of the misfortunes of his
family, and he deeply sympathized in his distress. He had lately married
and settled in life: his name was Vincent.</p>

<p>When Alonzo arrived at the house of his friend, he was received with
the same disinterested ardour he <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’had ever’">ever had</ins> been in the <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ’days’">day</ins> of his most unbounded prosperity.&mdash;After
being seated, Vincent told him that the occasion of his sending for him
was to propose the adoption of certain measures which he doubted not
might be considered highly beneficial as it respected his future peace
and happiness. “Your family misfortunes, continued Vincent, have reached
the ears of Melissa’s father. I&nbsp;know <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ’the’">that</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
old gentleman too well to believe he will consent to receive you as his
son-in-law, under your present embarrassments. Money is the god to which
he implicitly bows. The case is difficult, but not insurmountable. You
must first see Melissa; she is now in the next room. I&nbsp;will
introduce you in; converse with her, after which I will lay my plan
before you.”</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>

<p>Alonzo entered the room; Melissa was sitting by a window which looked
into a pleasant garden, and over verdant meadows whose tall grass waved
to the evening breeze. Farther on, low vallies spread their umbrageous
thickets, where the dusky shadows of night had <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’began’">begun</ins> to assemble.</p>

<p>On high hills beyond, the tops of lofty forests, majestically moved
by the billowy gales, caught the sun’s last ray. Fleecy summer clouds
hovered around the verge of the western horizon, spangled with silvery
tints or fringed with the gold of <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’even’">evening</ins>.</p>

<p>A mournfully murmuring rivulet purled at a little distance from the
garden, on the borders of a small grove, from whence the American wild
dove wafted her sympathetic moaning to the ear of Melissa. She sat
leaning on a small table by the window, which was thrown up. Her
attention was fixed. She did not perceive Vincent and Alonzo as they
entered. They advanced
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
towards her. She turned, started, and arose. With a melancholy smile,
and tremulous voice, “I&nbsp;supposed, she said, that it was Mrs.
Vincent who was approaching, as she has just left the room.” Her
countenance appeared <ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">to
be</ins> dejected, which, on <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">her</ins> seeing Alonzo, lighted up into a languid sprightliness.
It was evident she had been weeping.</p>

<p>Vincent retired, and Alonzo and Melissa seated themselves by the
window. “I&nbsp;have broken in upon your solitude, perhaps, too
unseasonably, said Alonzo. It is however, the fault of Vincent:&mdash;he
invited me to walk into the room, but did not inform me that you were
alone.” “Your presence was sudden and unexpected, but not unseasonable,
replied Melissa. I&nbsp;hope that you did not consider any formality
necessary in your visits, Alonzo.”</p>

<p>Alonzo. I once did not think so. Now I know not what to think&mdash;I
know not how to act. You have heard of the misfortunes of my father’s
family, Melissa?</p>

<p>Mel. Yes; I have heard the circumstances attending that
event&mdash;an event in which no one could be more deeply interested,
except the immediate sufferers, than myself.</p>

<p>Al. Your father is also acquainted with my present situation?</p>

<p>Mel. He is.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<p>Al. How did he receive the intelligence?</p>

<p>Mel. With deep regret.</p>

<p>Al. And forbade you to admit my addresses any longer?</p>

<p>Mel. No, not absolutely.</p>

<p>Al. If even in an unqualified or indirect manner, it is proper <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">that</ins> I should
know&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Mel. It certainly is. Soon after we received the intelligence of your
family misfortunes, my father came into the room where I was sitting;
“Melissa, said he, your conduct has ever been that of a dutiful child;
mine, of an indulgent parent.&mdash;My first, my ultimate wish, is to
see my children, when settled in life, happy and honourably respected.
For this purpose, I&nbsp;have bestowed on them a proper education, and
design suitably to apportion my property between them. On their part, it
is expected they will act prudently and discreetly, especially in those
things which concern their future peace and welfare.&mdash;The principal
requisite to ensure this is a proper connexion in marriage.” Here my
father paused a considerable time, and then continued&mdash;“I know, my
child, that your situation is a very delicate one. Your marriage day is
appointed; it was appointed under the fairest prospects; by the failure
of Alonzo’s father, those prospects have become deeply darkened, if not
totally obliterated.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<p>“To commit your fortune through life, to a person unable to support
you, would be hazardous in the extreme. The marriage day can at least be
suspended; perhaps something more favourable may appear.&mdash;At any
rate, I&nbsp;have too much confidence in your discretion, to suppose
that you will, by any rash act, bring either poverty or reproach upon
yourself or your connexions.” Thus <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’spoke’">spake</ins> my father, and immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>“In our present dilemma, said <ins class = "correction"
title = ", missing">Alonzo,</ins> what is proper to be done?”</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“It</ins> is
difficult to determine, replied Melissa. Should my father expressly
forbid our union, he will go all lengths to carry his commands into
effect. Although a tender parent, he is violent in his prejudices, and
resolute in his purposes. I&nbsp;would advise you to call at my father’s
house tomorrow, with your usual freedom. Whatever may be the event,
I&nbsp;shall deal sincerely with you. Mr. and Mrs. Vincent are now my
only <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’confidents’">confidants</ins>. From them you will be <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘enable’">enabled</ins> to obtain
information, should I be debarred from seeing you. I&nbsp;am frequently
here; they told me they expected you, but at what day was not known.
Mrs. Vincent has been my friend and associate from my earliest years.
Vincent you know.
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘In // In’ at page break">In</ins> them we can place the utmost confidence. My reliance on
Providence, I&nbsp;trust, will never be shaken; but my future prospects,
at present, are dark and gloomy.”</p>

<p>“Let us not despair, answered Alonzo; perhaps <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’these’">those</ins> gloomy clouds which now hover around
us, will yet be dissipated by the bright beams of joy. Innocence and
virtue are the cares of Heaven. There lies my hope. To-morrow, as you
propose, I&nbsp;will call at <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘you’">your</ins> father’s.”</p>

<p>Melissa now prepared to return home; a whippoorwill tuned its nightly
song at a little distance; but the sound, <del class = "other" title =
"1870 omits">late</del> so cheerful and sprightly, now passed heavily
over their hearts.</p>

<p>When Alonzo returned, Vincent unfolded the plan he had projected. “No
sooner, said he, was I informed of your misfortunes, than I was
convinced that Melissa’s father would endeavour to dissolve your
intended union with his daughter. I&nbsp;have known him many years, and
however he may dote on his children, or value their happiness, he will
not hesitate to sacrifice his other feelings to the acquirement of
riches. It appeared that you had but one resource left. You and Melissa
are now united by the most solemn ties&mdash;by every rite except those
which are merely ceremonial. These I
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
would advise you to enter into, and trust to the consequences. Mrs.
Vincent has proposed <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’this’">the</ins> scheme to Melissa; but implicitly accustomed to filial
obedience, she shudders at the idea of a clandestine marriage. But when
her father shall proceed to rigorous measures, she will, I&nbsp;think,
consent to the alternative. And this measure, once adopted, her father
must consent also; or, if not, you secure your own happiness, and, what
you esteem more, that of Melissa.”</p>

<p>“But you must be sensible of my inability to support her as she
deserves, replied Alonzo, even should she consent to&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“The</ins>
world is before you, answered Vincent; you have friends, you have
acquirements which will not fail you. In a country like this, you can
hardly fail of obtaining a competency, which, with the other requisites,
will ensure your independence and felicity.”</p>

<p>Alonzo informed Vincent what had been agreed upon between Melissa and
himself, respecting his visiting her on the morrow; “after which, he
said, we will discourse further on the subject.”</p>

<p>The next day Alonzo repaired to the house of Melissa’s father. As he
approached he saw Melissa sitting in a shady recess at one end of the
garden near which the road passed. She was leaning with her
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
head upon her hand, in a pensive posture; a&nbsp;deep dejection was
depicted <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’in’">upon</ins> her
features, which enlivened into a transient glow as soon as she saw
Alonzo. She arose, met him, and invited him into the house.</p>

<p>Alonzo was received with a <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’cold’">cool</ins> reserve by all except Melissa. Her father saluted him
with a distant and retiring bow, as he passed with Melissa to her room.
As soon as they were seated, a&nbsp;maiden aunt, who had doubled her
teens, outlived many of her suiters, and who had lately come to reside
with the family, entered, and seated herself by the window, alternately
humming a <ins class = "correction" title = ", invisible">tune,</ins>
and impudently staring at Alonzo, without speaking a word, except
snappishly, to contradict Melissa in any thing she advanced, which the
latter passed off with only a faint smile.</p>

<p>This interruption was not of long continuance. Melissa’s father <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">soon</ins> entered, and requested
the two ladies to withdraw, which was instantly done. He then addressed
Alonzo as follows:<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“When I gave
consent for you to marry my daughter, it was on the conviction that your
future resources would be adequate to support her honourably and
independently. Circumstances have since taken place, which render this
point extremely doubtful. Parental duty and affection <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ’demands’">demand</ins> that I should know your
means and prospects before I sanction
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
a proceeding which may reduce my child to penury and <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">to</del> want.”</p>

<p>He paused for a reply, but Alonzo was silent. He continued&mdash;“You
yourself must acknowledge, that to burthen yourself with the expense of
a family; to transfer a woman from affluence to poverty, without even an
object in view to provide for either, would be the height of folly and
extravagance.” Again he paused, but Alonzo was still silent. He
proceeded&mdash;“Could you, Alonzo, suffer life, when you see the wife
of your bosom, probably your infant children, pining in misery for want
of bread? And what else have you to expect if you marry in your present
situation? <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">I know you have
talents and have had an education. But what are they without
means?</ins> You have friends and well wishers; but which of them will
advance you four or five thousand pounds, as a gratuity? My daughter
must be supported according to her rank and standing in life. Are you
enabled to do this? If not, you cannot reasonably suppose that I shall
consent to your marrying her. You may say that your acquirements, your
prudence, and your industry, will procure you a handsome support. This
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’may well’">well may</ins> do in
single life; but to depend on these for the future exigencies of a
family, is hazarding peace, honour and reputation, at a single game of
chance. If, therefore, you have no resources or <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/70 ’expectations’">expectation</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
but such as these, your own judgment will teach you the necessity of
immediately relinquishing all pretensions to the hand <ins class =
"change"
title = "1804 ‘of Melissa.” Thus spake the father of Melissa, and’">of Melissa”&mdash;and</ins> immediately left the room.</p>

<p>Why was Alonzo speechless through the whole of this
discourse?&mdash;What reply could he have made? What were the prospects
before him but penury, want, misery, and woe! Where, indeed, were the
means by which Melissa was to be shielded from poverty, if connected
with his fortunes. The idea was not new, but it <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’come’">came</ins> upon him with redoubled anguish. He
arose and looked around for Melissa, but she was not to be seen. He left
the house, and walked slowly towards Vincent’s. At a little distance he
met Melissa, who had been strolling in an adjoining avenue. He informed
her of all that had passed; it was no more than they both expected, yet
it was a shock their fortitude could scarcely <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’contain’">sustain</ins>. Disappointment seldom finds <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ’its’">her</ins> votaries prepared to
receive her.</p>

<p>Melissa told Alonzo, that her father’s determinations were
unchangeable; that his sister (the before mentioned maiden lady) held a
considerable influence over him, and dictated the concerns of the
family; and that from her, there was nothing to hope in their favour.
Her mother, she said, was her friend, but could not <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ’counteract’">contradict</ins> the
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
will of her father. Her brother would be at home in a few days; how he
would act on this occasion she was unable to say: but were he even their
friend he would have but feeble influence with her father and aunt.
“What is to be the end of these troubles, continued Melissa, it is
impossible to foresee. Let us trust in the mercy of heaven and submit to
its dispensations.”</p>

<p>Alonzo and Melissa, in their happier days, had, when absent,
corresponded by letters. This method it was now thought best to
relinquish. It was agreed that Alonzo should come frequently to
Vincent’s, where Melissa would meet him as she could find opportunities.
Having concluded on this, Melissa returned home, and Alonzo to the house
of his friend.</p>

<p>Vincent, after Alonzo had related <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the manner of</del> his reception at Melissa’s father’s, urged
the plan he had projected of a private marriage. Alonzo replied, that
even should Melissa consent to it, which he much doubted, it must be a
measure of the last resort, and adopted only when all others became
fruitless.</p>

<p>The next morning Alonzo returned to the hut where his aged parents
now dwelt. His bosom throbbed with keen anguish. His own fate,
unconnected with that of Melissa, he considered of little consequence.
But
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘what’">their united situation
tortured his soul.&mdash;What</ins> was to become of Melissa, what of
himself, what of his parents!&mdash;“Alas, said Alonzo, I&nbsp;now
perceive what it is to want the good things of this life.”</p>

<p>Alonzo’s father was absent when he arrived, but returned soon after.
A&nbsp;beam of joy gleamed upon his withered countenance as he entered
the house. “Were it not, Alonzo, for your unhappy situation, said he, we
should once more be restored to peace and comfort. A&nbsp;few persons
who were indebted to me, finding that I was to be sacrificed by my
unfeeling creditors, reserved those debts in their hands, and have now
paid me, amounting to something more than five hundred pounds. With <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">part of</ins> this I have purchased
a small, but well cultivated farm, with convenient tenements.
I&nbsp;have enough left to purchase what stock and other materials I
need; and to spare some for your present exigencies, Alonzo.”</p>

<p>Alonzo thanked his father for his kindness, but told him <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">that</del> from his former liberality he
had yet sufficient for his wants, and that he should soon find business
which would amply support him. “But your affair with Melissa, asked his
father, how is <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’it’">that</ins>
likely to terminate?” “<ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’Favourable’">Favourably</ins>, I&nbsp;hope, sir,” answered Alonzo. He
could not
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
consent to disturb the tranquillity of his parents by reciting his own
wretchedness.</p>

<p>A week passed away. Alonzo saw his parents removed to their little
farm, which was to be managed by his father and a hired man. He saw them
comfortably seated; he saw them serenely blest in the calm pleasures of
returning peace, and a ray of joy <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’illumined’">illuminated</ins> his troubled bosom.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Again the youth his wonted life regain’d,</p>
<p>A transient sparkle in his eye obtain’d,</p>
<p>A bright, impassion’d cheering glow, express’d</p>
<p>The pleas’d sensation of his tender breast:</p>
<p>But soon dark glooms the feeble smiles o’erspread;</p>
<p>Like morn’s <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’gray’">gay</ins>
hues, the fading splendours fled;</p>
<p>Returning anguish froze his feeling soul,</p>
<p>Deep sighs burst forth, and tears began to roll.”</p>
</div>

<p>He thought <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’on’">of</ins>
Melissa, from whom he had heard nothing since he last saw her.&mdash;He
thought <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’on’">of</ins> the
difficulties which surrounded him. He thought <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’on’">of</ins> the barriers which were opposed to his
happiness and the felicity of Melissa, and he set out for the house of
Vincent.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>

<p>Alonzo arrived at the residence of Vincent near the close of <del
class = "other" title = "1804 omits">the</del> day. Vincent and his lady
were at tea with several young ladies who had passed the afternoon with
Mrs. Vincent. Alonzo cast an active glance around the company, in hopes
to find Melissa, but she was not there. He was invited and accepted a
seat at table. After tea Vincent led him into an adjoining
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
room. “You have come in good time, said he. Something must speedily be
done, or you lose Melissa forever. The day after you <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ’left’">were</ins> here, her father received a
letter from Beauman, in which, after mentioning the circumstance of your
father’s insolvency, he hinted that the consequence would probably be a
failure of her proposed marriage with you, which might essentially
injure the reputation of a lady of her standing in life; to prevent
which, and to place her beyond the reach of calumny, he offered to marry
her at any appointed day, provided he had her free consent.</p>

<p>“As Beauman, by the recent death of his father, had been put in
possession of a splendid fortune, the proposition allured her father,
who wrote him a complaisant answer, with an invitation to his
house.&mdash;He then strove to extort a promise from Melissa, that she
would break off all connexion with you, see you no more, and admit the
addresses of Beauman.</p>

<p>“To this she could not consent. She urged, that by the consent of her
parents she was engaged to you by the most sacred ties. That to her
father’s will she had hitherto yielded implicit obedience, but that
hastily to break the most solemn obligation, formed and sanctioned by
his approbation and direction, was what her conscience would not
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
permit her to do. Were he to command her to live single, life might be
endured; but to give her hand to any except you, would be to perjure
those principles of truth and justice which he himself had ever taught
her to hold most inviolable.&mdash;Her father grew outrageous; charged
her with disobedience, with a blind inconsiderate perverseness, by which
she would bring ruin upon herself, and indelible disgrace upon her
family. She answered only with her tears. Her mother interposed, and
endeavoured to appease his anger; but he spurned her from him, and
rushed out of the room, uttering a threat that force should succeed
persuasion, if his commands were not obeyed. To add to Melissa’s
distress, Beauman arrived at her father’s yesterday; and I hope, in some
measure to alleviate it. Edgar, her brother, <ins class = "change" title
= "1811 ’come’">came</ins> this morning.&mdash;Mrs. Vincent has
dispatched a message to inform Melissa of your arrival, and to desire
her to come here immediately. She will undoubtedly comply with the
invitation, if not prevented by something extraordinary. I&nbsp;should
have written you had I not hourly expected you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Vincent now <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’come’">came</ins> to the door of the room and beckoned to her husband,
who went out, but immediately returned, leading in Melissa after which
he retired.
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
“Oh, Alonzo!” was all she could say, and burst into tears. Alonzo led
her to a seat, gently pressed her hand, and mingled his tears with hers,
but was unable to speak.&mdash;Recovering at length, he begged her to
moderate her grief. “Where<del class = "other"
title = "1804/11/70 omit">, said he,</del> is your fortitude and <del class = "other" title
= "1870 omits">your</del> firmness, <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11/70">said he,</ins> Melissa, which I have so often seen
triumphing over affliction?” Her extreme anguish prevented a reply.
Deeply affected and alarmed at the storm of distress which raged in her
bosom, he endeavoured to console her, though consolation was a stranger
to his own breast. “Let us not, Melissa, said he, increase our flood of
affliction by a tide of useless sorrow. Perhaps more prosperous days are
yet in reserve for us;&mdash;happiness may yet be ours.” “Never, never!
she exclaimed. Oh, what will become of me!” “Heaven cannot desert you,
said Alonzo; as well might it desert its angels. This thorny and gloomy
path may lead to fair fields of light and verdure. Tempests are
succeeded by calms; <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’war ends’">wars
end</ins> in peace; the splendours of the brightest morning arise on the
wings of <ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">the</ins> blackest
midnight.<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Troubles will not
always last. Life at most is short. Death comes to the relief of the
virtuous wretched, and transports them to another and <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/70">a</ins> better world, where sighing and
sorrows cease,
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
and the tempestuous passions of life are known no more.”</p>

<p>The rage of grief which had overwhelmed Melissa began now to subside,
as the waves of the ocean gradually cease their tumultuous commotion,
after the turbulent winds are laid asleep. Deep sobs and long drawn
sighs succeeded to a suffocation of tears. The irritation of her
feelings had caused a more than usual glow upon her cheek, which faded
away as she became composed, until a livid paleness spread itself over
her features. Alonzo feared that the delicacy of her constitution would
fall a sacrifice to the sorrow which preyed upon her heart, if not
speedily alleviated;&mdash;but <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’where, alas’">alas! where</ins> were the means of alleviation?</p>

<p>She informed him that her father had that evening ordered her to <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">prepare to</ins> become the wife of
Beauman. He told her that her disobedience was no longer to be
borne.&mdash;“No longer, said he, will I tamper with your perverseness:
you are determined to be poor, wretched and contemptible. I&nbsp;will
compel you to be rich, happy, and respected. You suffer the <ins class =
"change"
title = "1870 ’Jack-with-a-lantern’"><i>Jack-a-lantern</i></ins> fancy to lead you
into swamps and quagmires, when, did you but follow the fair light of
reason, it would conduct you to honour and real felicity. There are
happiness and misery at your choice.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<p>“Marry Beauman, and you <del class = "other"
title = "1804 omits">will</del> roll in your coach, flaunt in your silks; your
furniture and your <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’equippage’">equipage</ins> are splendid, your associates are of the
first character, and your father rejoices in your prosperity.</p>

<p>“Marry Alonzo, you sink into obscurity, are condemned to drudgery,
poorly fed, worse clothed, and your relations and acquaintances shun and
despise you. The comparison I have here drawn between Beauman and Alonzo
is a correct one; for even the wardrobe of the former is of more value
than the whole fortune of the latter.</p>

<p>“I give you now two days to consider <ins class = "other" title =
"1870 only">of</ins> the matter; at the end of that time I shall expect
your decision, and hope you will decide <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/11/70 ’discreetly’">discretely</ins>. But remember that you become
the wife of Beauman, or you are no longer acknowledged as my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Thus, said Melissa, did my father pronounce his determination, which
shook my frame, and chilled with horror every nerve of my heart, and
immediately left&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“My aunt added her taunts to his severities, and Beauman interfered
with his ill-timed consolation. My mother and <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘Edgar,’ (with comma)">Edgar</ins> ardently strove to
allay the fever of my soul, and mitigate my distress. But the stroke was
almost too severe for my nature. Habituated only to the smiles of my
father, how could I support his frowns?&mdash;Accustomed
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
to receive his blessings alone, how could I endure his sudden
malediction.”</p>

<p>Description would fail in painting the sensations of Alonzo’s bosom,
at this recital of woe. But he endeavoured to mitigate her sorrows by
the consolation of more cheering prospects and happier hours.</p>

<p>Vincent and his lady now came into the room. They strenuously urged
the propriety and the necessity of Alonzo and Melissa’s entering into
the bands of wedlock immediately. “The measure would be hazardous,”
remarked Melissa. “My circumstances”&mdash;said Alonzo. “Not on that
account, interrupted Melissa, but my father’s displeasure<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” “Will be the same, whether you marry
Alonzo, or refuse to marry Beauman,” replied Vincent. Her resolution
appeared to be staggered.</p>

<p>“Come here, Melissa, to-morrow evening, said Mrs. Vincent; mean time
you will consider the matter, and then determine.” To this Melissa
assented, and prepared to return home.</p>

<p>Alonzo walked with her to the gate which opened into the yard
surrounding her father’s house. It was dangerous for him to go farther.
Should he be discovered with Melissa, even by a domestic of the family,
it must increase the persecutions against her. They parted. Alonzo stood
at the gate,
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
gazing anxiously after Melissa as she walked up the long winding avenue,
bordered with the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’odor-flowering’">odour-flowing</ins> lilac, and lofty elm, her white
robes now invisible, now dimly seen as she turned the angles of the
walk, until they were totally obscured, mingling with the gloom and
darkness of the night. “Thus, said Alonzo, thus fades the angel of peace
from the visionary eyes of the war-worn soldier, when it ascends in the
dusky clouds of early morning, while he slumbers on the field of recent
battle.”&mdash;With mournful forebodings he returned to the house of
Vincent. He arose after a sleepless <ins class = "correction" title =
"1851 ‘nights’">night</ins> and walked into an adjoining field. He stood
leaning in deep contemplation against a tree, when he heard quick
footsteps behind him. He turned <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">round</ins>, and saw Edgar approaching: in a moment they were in
each other’s arms, and <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’mingling’">mingled</ins> tears. They returned to Vincent’s and
conversed largely on present affairs. “I&nbsp;have discoursed with my
father on the subject, said Edgar. I&nbsp;have urged him with every
possible argument to relinquish his determination: I&nbsp;fear, however,
he is inflexible.</p>

<p>“To assuage the tempest of grief which rent Melissa’s bosom was my
next object, and in this I trust I have not been unsuccessful. You will
see her this evening, and will find her more calm and resigned. You,
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
Alonzo, must <ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">ever</ins> exert
your fortitude. The ways of Heaven are inscrutable, but they are
right.</p>

<p>“We must acquiesce in its dealings. We cannot alter its decrees.
Resignation to its will, whether merciful or afflictive, is one of those
eminent virtues which adorn the good man’s character, and <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">which</ins> ever find a brilliant reward in
the regions of unsullied splendour, far beyond trouble and the
tomb.”</p>

<p>Edgar told Alonzo that circumstances compelled him that day to depart
for the army. <ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing or invisible">“I</ins>&nbsp;would advise you, said he, to remain here until
your affair comes to some final issue. It must, I&nbsp;think, ere long,
be <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’determined’">terminated</ins>.
Perhaps you and my sister may yet be happy.”</p>

<p>Alonzo feelingly expressed his gratitude to Edgar. He found in him
that disinterested friendship, which his early youth had experienced.
Edgar the same day departed for the army.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Alonzo received a note from Melissa’s father,
requesting his immediate attendance. Surprised at the incident, he
repaired there immediately. The servant introduced him into a room where
Melissa’s father and aunt were sitting.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Hearing you were in the neighbourhood, said
her father, I&nbsp;have sent for you, to make a proposition, which after
what has taken
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
place, I&nbsp;think you cannot hesitate to comply with. The occurrence
of previous circumstances may lead you to suppose that my daughter is
under obligations to you, which may render it improper for her to form
marriage connections with any other. Whatever embarrassments your
addresses to her may have produced, it is in your power to remove
them<del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">; and if you are a man of
honour you will remove them</del>. You cannot wish to involve Melissa in
your present penurious condition, unless you wish to make her wretched.
It therefore only remains for you to give me a writing, voluntarily
resigning all pretensions to the hand of my daughter; and if you wish
her to be happy, honourable, and respected in this life, this I say you
will not hesitate to&nbsp;do.”</p>

<p>A considerable pause ensued. Alonzo at length replied, “I&nbsp;cannot
perceive any particular advantage that can accrue from such a measure.
It will neither add nor diminish the power you possess to command
obedience to your will, if you are determined to command it, either from
your daughter, or your servant.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“There, brother,” bawled the old maid, half <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’speaking’">squeaking</ins> through her nose, which was
well charged with rappee, “did’nt I tell you so? I&nbsp;knew the fellow
would <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’come to no’">not come
to</ins> terms no more than will your refractory
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
daughter. This love fairly bewitches such foolish, crack-brained
youngsters. But say Mr. <span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>,
what’s your name, addressing herself to Alonzo, will love heat the oven?
will love boil the pot? will love clothe the back? will love<span class
= "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“You will not, interrupted Melissa’s father, speaking to Alonzo, it
seems, consent to my proposition? I&nbsp;have then, one demand to make,
which of right you cannot deny. Promise me that you will never see my
daughter again, unless by my permission.”</p>

<p>“At the present moment I shall promise you nothing,” replied Alonzo,
with some warmth.</p>

<p>“There again, said the old maid, just so Melissa told you this
morning, when you requested her to see him no more. The fellow has
fairly betwattled her.<!-- too easy --> I wish I had him to deal with.
Things wasn’t so when I was a girl; I&nbsp;kept the rogues at a
distance, I’ll warrant you. I&nbsp;always told you, brother, what would
come of your indulgence to your daughter. <del class = "other" title =
"1870 omits">And</del> I should not wonder if you should soon find <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">that</ins> the girl had eloped, and
your desk robbed <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’into’">in</ins>
the bargain.”</p>

<p>Alonzo hastily arose: “I suppose, said he, my presence can be
dispensed with.”</p>

<p>“Well, young man, said Melissa’s father,
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
since you will not comply with any overtures I make; since you will not
accede to any terms I propose, remember, sir, I&nbsp;now warn you to
break off all communication and correspondence with my daughter, and to
relinquish all expectations concerning her. I&nbsp;shall never consent
to marry my daughter to a beggar.”</p>

<p>“Beggar!” involuntarily exclaimed Alonzo, and his eyes <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ’flashed’ 1870 ’flashed with’">flashed in</ins>
resentment.&mdash;But he recollected that it was the father of Melissa
who had thus insulted him, and he suppressed his anger. He rushed out of
the house, and returned to Vincent’s. He had neither heard nor seen any
thing of Melissa or Beauman.</p>

<p>Night came on, and he ardently and impatiently expected Melissa. He
anticipated the consolation her presence would bestow. Edgar had told
him she was more composed. He doubted whether it were proper to excite
anew her distress by relating his interview with her father, unless she
was <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">already</ins> <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ’apprised’">appraised</ins> of it. The evening
passed on, but Melissa came not. Alonzo grew restless and uneasy. He
looked out, then at his watch. Vincent and his lady assured him <del
class = "other" title = "1804 omits">that</del> she would soon be there.
He paced <ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ’his’">the</ins> room.
Still he became more impatient. He walked out on the way <del class =
"other" title = "1804 omits">where</del> she was expected to come.
Sometimes he
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
advanced hastily; at others he moved slowly; then stood motionless,
listening in breathless silence, momentarily expecting to discover her
white form approaching through the gloom, or to hear the sound of her
footsteps advancing amidst the darkness. Shapeless objects, either real
or imaginary, frequently crossed his sight, but, like the unreal
phantoms of night, they suddenly passed away, and were seen no more. At
length he perceived a dusky white form advancing in the distant dim
obscurity. It drew near; his heart beat in quick succession; his fond
hopes told him it was Melissa. The object came up, and hastily passed
him, with a “good night, sir.”</p>

<p>It was a stranger in a white surtout. Alonzo hesitated whether to
advance or to return. It was possible, though not probable, that Melissa
might have come some other way. He hastened back to Vincent’s&mdash;she
had not arrived. “Something extraordinary, said Mrs. Vincent, has
prevented her coming. Perhaps she is ill.”&mdash;Alonzo shuddered at the
suggestion. He looked at his watch; it was half past eleven o’clock.
Again he hastily sallied out, and took the road to her father’s.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>

<p>The night was exceedingly dark, and illuminated only by the feeble
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’glimmer’">glimmering</ins> of the
twinkling stars. When he came within
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
sight of the house, and as he drew near no lights were visible&mdash;all
was still and silent. He entered the yard, walked up the avenue, and
approached the door. The familiar watch-dog, which lay near the
threshold, fawned upon him, joyfully whining and wagging his tail. “Thou
still knowest me, <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’Carlow’">Curlow</ins>, said Alonzo; thou hast known me in better days;
I&nbsp;am now poor and wretched, but thy friendship is the same.”
A&nbsp;solemn stillness prevailed all around, interrupted only by the
discordance of the nightly insects, and the hooting of the moping owl
from the neighbouring forest.&mdash;The dwelling was shrouded in
darkness. In Melissa’s room no gleam of light appeared. “They are all
buried in sleep, said Alonzo, deeply sighing, and I have only to return
in disappointment.”</p>

<p>He turned and walked towards the street; casting his eyes back, the
blaze of a candle caught his sight. It passed rapidly along through the
lower rooms, now gleaming, now intercepted, as the walls or the windows
intervened, and suddenly disappeared. Alonzo gazed earnestly a few
moments, and hastily returned back. No noise was to be heard, no new
objects were discernible.&mdash;He clambered over the garden wall, and
went around to the back side of the house. Here all <ins class =
"correction" title = "‘s’ invisible">was</ins> solemn<ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">, dark</ins> and silent as in front.
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
Immediately a faint light appeared through one of the chamber windows;
it grew brighter; a&nbsp;candle entered the chamber; the sash was flung
up, and Melissa seated herself at the window<ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 has superfluous close quote">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>The weather was sultry, she held a fan in her hand; her countenance,
though stamped with deep dejection, was marked with serenity, but pale
as the drooping lily of the valley. Alonzo placed himself directly under
the window, and in a low voice called her by name. She started wildly,
looked out, and faintly cried, “Who’s there?” He answered, “Alonzo.”
“Good heavens, she exclaimed, is it you, Alonzo? I&nbsp;was disappointed
in meeting you at Vincent’s this evening; my father will not suffer me
to go out without attendants. I&nbsp;am now constantly watched and
guarded.”</p>

<p>“Watched and guarded! replied Alonzo: At the risque of my life I will
deliver you from the tyranny with which you are oppressed.”</p>

<p>“Be calm, Alonzo, said she, I think it will not <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ’long last’">last long</ins>. Beauman will soon depart,
after which there will undoubtedly be some alteration. Desire Mrs.
Vincent to come here to-morrow; I&nbsp;believe they will <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ’trust me to’">let me</ins> see her. I&nbsp;can,
from time to time, inform you of passing events, so that you may know
what changes take place. I&nbsp;am
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
placed under the care of my aunt, who suffers me not to step out of her
sight. We pass the night in an adjoining chamber&mdash;from whence,
after she had fallen asleep, I&nbsp;stole out, and went down with a
design of walking in the garden, but found the doors all locked and the
keys taken out. I&nbsp;returned and raised <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ’my’">this</ins> window for fresh air. Hark! said she; my aunt
calls me. She has waked and misses me. I&nbsp;must fly to her chamber.
You shall hear more from me to-morrow by Mrs. Vincent, Alonzo.” So
saying, she let down the window sash, and retired.</p>

<p>Alonzo withdrew slowly from the place, and repassed the way he came.
As he jumped back over the garden wall, he found a man standing at its
foot, very near him: after a moment’s scrutiny he perceived it to be
Beauman. “What, my chevalier, said he to Alonzo, such an adept in the
amorous science already? Hast thou then eluded the watchful eyes of
Argus, and the vigilance of the dragon!”</p>

<p>“Unfeeling and impertinent <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851/70 ‘intruder?’">intruder,</ins> retorted Alonzo, seizing hold of him; is it
not enough that an innocent daughter must endure a merciless parent’s
persecuting hand, but must thou add to her misery by thy disgusting
interference!”</p>

<p>“Quit thy hold, tarquin, said Beauman.
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
Art thou determined, after storming the fortress, to murder the
garrison?”</p>

<p>“Go, said Alonzo, quitting him; go sir, you are unworthy of my anger.
Pursue thy grovelling schemes. Strive to force to your arms a lady who
abhors you, and were it <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’on no other’">not on one</ins> account, must ever continue to <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ’hate and despise’">despise and hate</ins>
you.”</p>

<p>“Alonzo, replied Beauman, I perceive thou knowest me not. You and I
were rivals in our pursuit&mdash;the hand of Melissa. Whether from freak
or fortune, the preference was given to you, and I retired in silence.
From <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">a</ins> coincidence of
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’consequences’">circumstances</ins>,
her father has now been induced to give the preference to me. My belief
was, that Melissa would comply with her father’s will, especially after
her prospects of connecting with you were cut off by the events which
ruined your fortune. You, Alonzo, have yet, I&nbsp;find, to learn the
character of women. It has been my particular study. Melissa, now
ardently impassioned by first impressions, irritated by recent
disappointment, her passions delicate and vivid, her affections animated
and unmixed, it would be strange, if she could suddenly relinquish
primitive attachments founded on such premises, without a struggle. But
remove her from your presence <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">for</del> one year, with only distant and uncertain prospects of
seeing
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
you again, admit me as the substitute in your absence, and she accepts
my hand as freely as she would now receive yours. I&nbsp;had no
design&mdash;it was never my wish to marry her without her consent. That
I believe I shall yet obtain. Under existing circumstances, it is
impossible but <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">that</del> you
must be separated for some considerable time. Then, when cool
deliberation succeeds to the wild vagaries, the electric fire of frolic
fancy, she will discover the dangerous precipice, the deadly abyss to
which her present conduct and inclinations lead. She will see that the
blandishments, without the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’possession’">possessions</ins> of life, must fade and die. She will
discriminate between the shreds and <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the</del> trappings of taste. She will prefer indifference and
splendour to love and a cottage.</p>

<p>“At present I relinquish all <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’farther pursuit’ 1811/70 ‘further pursuit’">further persuit</ins>;
to-morrow I return to New-London. When Melissa, from calm deliberation
and the advice of friends, shall freely consent to yield me her hand,
I&nbsp;shall return to receive it. I&nbsp;came from my lodgings this
evening to declare these intentions to her father: but it being later
than I was aware of, the family had <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’retired’">gone</ins> to rest. I&nbsp;was about to return, when I saw a
light from <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’a’">the</ins> chamber
window, which soon withdrew. I&nbsp;stood a moment by the garden wall,
when
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
you approached and discovered me.” So saying, he bade Alonzo good night,
and walked hastily away. “I&nbsp;find he knows not the character of
Melissa,” said Alonzo, and returned to Vincent’s.</p>

<p>The next day Alonzo told the Vincents of all that had passed, and it
was agreed that Mrs. Vincent should visit at Melissa’s father’s that
afternoon. She went at an early hour. Alonzo’s feelings were on the <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ’wrack’ 1811 ’wreck’">rack</ins> until
she returned, which happened much sooner than was expected; when she
gave him and Vincent the following information:</p>

<p>“When I arrived there, said she, I found Melissa’s father and mother
alone, her mother was in tears, which she endeavoured to conceal. Her
father soon withdrew. After some conversation I enquired for Melissa.
The old lady burst into tears, and informed me that this morning
Melissa’s aunt <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">(the old
maid)</del> had invited her to ride out with her. A&nbsp;carriage was
provided, which, after a large trunk had been placed therein, drove off
with Melissa and her aunt; that Melissa’s father had just been informing
her that he had sent their daughter to a <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ’different’">distant</ins> part of the country, where she was to
reside with a friend until Alonzo should depart from the neighbourhood.
The reason of this sudden resolution was his being
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
informed by Beauman, that notwithstanding his precaution, Melissa and
Alonzo had an interview the last evening. Where she was sent to, the old
lady could not tell, but she was convinced that Melissa was not apprised
of the design when she consented to go. Her aunt had heretofore been
living with the <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">different</ins>
relatives of the family in various parts of the state.”</p>

<p>Alonzo listened to Mrs. Vincent’s relation with inexpressible
agitation. He sat silent a few moments; then suddenly <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ’started’">starting</ins> up, “I&nbsp;will
find her if she be on the earth!” said he, and in spite of Vincent’s
attempts to prevent him, rushed out of the house, flew to the road, and
was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>Melissa had not<del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">,
indeed,</del> the most distant suspicion of the designs of her father
and aunt. The latter informed her that she was going to take a <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ’morning’">morning’s</ins> ride, and
invited Melissa to accompany her, to which she consented. She did not
even perceive the trunk <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’that’">which</ins> was fastened on behind the carriage. They were
attended by a single servant. They drove to a neighbouring town, where
Melissa had frequently attended her father <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/11 ’or’">and</ins> mother to purchase articles of dress, &amp;c.
where they alighted at a friend’s house, and lingered away the time
until dinner; after which, they prepared,
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
as Melissa supposed, to return, but found, to her surprise, after they
had entered the carriage, that her aunt <ins class = "other" title =
"1870 only">had</ins> ordered the driver to proceed a different way. She
asked her aunt if they were not going home. “Not yet,” said she. Melissa
grew uneasy; she knew <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">that</ins> she was to see Mrs. Vincent that afternoon; she knew
the disappointment which Alonzo must experience, if she was absent. She
begged her aunt to return, as she expected the company of some ladies
that afternoon. “Then they must be disappointed, child,” said her
aunt.&mdash;Melissa knew it was in vain to remonstrate; she supposed her
aunt was bent on visiting some of her acquaintance, and she remained
silent.</p>

<p>They arrived at another <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">small</ins> village, and alighted at an inn, where Melissa and her
aunt tarried, while the servant was ordered out by the latter on some
business unknown to Melissa. When they again got into the carriage she
perceived several large packages and bundles, which had been deposited
there since they left it. She enquired of her aunt what they contained.
“Articles for family use, child,” she replied, and ordered the driver to
proceed.</p>

<p>They passed along winding and solitary paths, into a bye road which
led through an unfrequented wood, that opened into a
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
rocky part of the country bordering on the Sound. Here they stopped at
the only house in view. It was a miserable hut, built of logs, and
boarded with slabs. They alighted from the carriage, and Melissa’s
aunt<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’ handed’">, handing</ins> the
driver a large bunch of keys, “remember to do as I have told you,” said
she, and he drove rapidly away. It was with some difficulty they got
into the hut, as a meagre cow, with a long yoke on her neck,
a&nbsp;board before her eyes, and a cross piece on her horns, stood with
her head in the door. On one side of her were four or five half starved
squeaking pigs, on the other a flock of gaggling geese.</p>

<p>As they entered the door, a woman who sat carding wool jumped up, “La
me! <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’cried she’">she cried</ins>,
here is Miss D<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, welcome here
again. How does madam do?” dropping a low curtsey. She was dressed in a
linsey woolsey short gown, a&nbsp;petticoat of the same, her hair
hanging about her ears, and barefoot. Three dirty, ragged children were
playing about the floor, and the furniture was of a piece with the
building. “Is my room in order?” enquired Melissa’s aunt. “It hasn’t
been touched since madam was here,” answered the woman, and immediately
stalked away to a little back apartment, which Melissa and her aunt
entered. It was small, but neatly furnished, and contained
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
a single bed. This appendage had been concealed from Melissa’s view, as
it was the opposite side of the house from <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ’where’">whence</ins> she alighted. “Where is John?” asked
Melissa’s aunt. “My husband is in the garden, replied the woman;
I&nbsp;will call him,” and out she scampered. John soon appeared, and
exhibited an exact counter part of his wife. “What does madam please to
want?” said he, bowing three or four times. “I&nbsp;want you John,” she
answered, and immediately stepped into the other room, and gave some
directions, in a low voice, to him and his wife. “La me! said the woman,
madam a’nt a going to live in that doleful place?” Melissa could not
understand her aunt’s reply, but heard her give directions to “first
hang on the teakettle.” This <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">was</ins> done, while John and his wife went out, <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">and</ins> Melissa’s aunt prepared tea in her
own room. In about an hour John and his wife returned, and gave the same
bunch of keys to Melissa’s aunt, which she had given to the servant who
drove the carriage.</p>

<p>Melissa was involved in inscrutable mystery respecting these
extraordinary proceedings. She conjectured that they boded her no good,
but she could not penetrate into her aunt’s <ins class = "change" title
= "1811 ’design’">designs</ins>. She frequently looked out, hoping to
see the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘return of the carriage’">carriage return</ins>,
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
but was disappointed. When tea was made ready, she could neither eat nor
drink. After her aunt had disposed of a dozen cups of tea, and an
adequate proportion of biscuit, butter and dried beef, she directed
Melissa to prepare to take a walk. The sun was low; they proceeded
through fields, in a foot path, over rough and uneven ways, directly
towards the Sound. They walked about a mile, when they came to a large,
old fashioned, castle-like building, surrounded by <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’high, thick walls’">a high, thick wall</ins>, and almost
totally concealed on all sides from the sight, by irregular rows of
large locusts and elm trees, dry prim<a class = "tag" name = "tagB" id =
"tagB" href = "#noteB">*</a> hedges,
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteB" id = "noteB" href = "#tagB">*</a>
The botanical name of this shrub is not recollected. There were formerly
a great number of prim hedges in New-England, and other parts of
America. What is most remarkable is, that they all died the year
previous to the commencement of the American war.</span> <!-- darn
pacifist prim hedges! -->
and green shrubbery. The gate which opened into the yard, was made of
strong hard wood, thickly crossed on the outside with iron bars, and
filled with old iron spikes. Melissa’s aunt unlocked the gate, and they
entered the yard, which was overgrown with rank grass and rushes: the
avenue which led to the house was almost in the same condition. The
house was of real Gothic architecture, built of rude stone, with
battlements.</p>

<p>The doors were constructed in the same
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
manner as the gate at which they entered the yard. They unlocked the
door, which <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’screaked’">creaked</ins> heavily on its hinges, and went in. They
ascended a flight of stairs, wound through several dark and empty rooms,
till they came to one which was handsomely furnished, with a fire
burning on the hearth. Two beds were in the room, with tables <del class
= "other" title = "1804 omits">and</del> chairs, and other conveniences
for house keeping. “Here we are safe, said Melissa’s aunt, as I have
<ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ’took’">taken</ins> care to lock
all the doors and gates after me; and here, Melissa, you are in the
mansion of your ancestors. Your great <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/70 ’grandfather’">grand father</ins>, who came over from England,
built this house in the earliest <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’settlement’">settlements</ins> of the country, and here he resided
until his death. The reason why so high and thick a wall was built round
it, and the doors and gates so strongly fortified, was to secure it
against the Indians, who frequently committed depredations on the early
settlers. Your <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’grand father’">grandfather</ins> came <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’into’">in</ins> possession of this estate after his father’s death: it
fell to me by will, with the lands surrounding it. The house has
sometimes been tenanted, at others not. It has now been vacant for a few
years. The lands are rented yearly. John, the person from whose house we
last came, is my overseer and tenant. I&nbsp;had a small room built,
adjoining that hut, where I generally
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
reside for a week when I come to receive my rents. I&nbsp;have thought
frequently of fitting up this place for my future residence, but
circumstances have hitherto hindered <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ’me from carrying my’">my carrying the</ins> scheme into effect, and
now, perhaps, it will never take place.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "paragraph indent missing; previous paragraph ends at line-end">“Your</ins> perverseness, Melissa, in
refusing to comply with the wishes of your friends, has induced us to
adopt <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’this’">the</ins> method of
bringing you here, where you are to remain until Alonzo leaves your
neighbourhood, at least. Notwithstanding your father’s injunctions and
my vigilance, you had a clandestine interview with him last night. So we
were told by Beauman this morning, before he set off for New-London, who
discovered him at your window. It therefore became necessary to remove
you immediately. You will want for nothing. John is to supply us with
whatever is needful.&mdash;You will not be long here; Alonzo will soon
be gone. You will think differently; return home, marry Beauman, and
become a lady.”</p>

<p>“My God! exclaimed Melissa, is it possible my father can be so cruel!
Is he so unfeeling as to banish me from his house, and confine me within
the walls of a prison, like a common malefactor?” She flung herself on
the bed in a state little inferior to distraction. Her aunt told her it
was
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
all owing to her own obstinacy, and because she refused to be made
happy&mdash;and went to preparing supper.</p>

<p>Melissa heard none of her aunt’s observations; she lay in a
stupifying agony, insensible to all that passed. When supper was ready,
her aunt endeavoured to arouse her. She started up, stared around her
with a wild <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">and</ins> agonizing
countenance, but spoke not a word. Her aunt became alarmed. She applied
stimulants to her temples and forehead, and persuaded her to take some
cordials. She remained seemingly insensible <ins class = "change" title
= "1804 ’throughout’">through</ins> the night: just at morning, she fell
into a slumber, interrupted by incoherent moanings, convulsive
startings, long <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">drawn</del>
sighs, intermitting sobs, and by frequent, sudden and restless turnings
from side to side. At length she appeared to be in a calm and quiet
sleep for about an hour. About sunrise she awoke&mdash;her aunt <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ’set’">sat</ins> by her bed side. She
gazed languidly about the room, and burst into tears. She wept a long
time; her aunt strove to console her, for she truly began to tremble,
lest Melissa’s distress should produce her immediate dissolution.
Towards night, however, she became more calm and resigned; but a slight
fever succeeded, which kept her confined for several days, after which
she slowly recovered.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>

<p>John came frequently to the house to receive the commands of
Melissa’s aunt, and brought such things as they wanted. Her aunt also
sometimes went home with him, leaving the keys of the house with
Melissa, but locking the gate and taking the key of that with her. <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">She generally returned before
sunset.</del> <!-- hmm, first she wants him, and now this... --> When
Melissa was so far recovered as to walk out, she found that the house
was situated on an eminence, about one hundred yards from the Sound. The
yard was large and extensive. Within the enclosure was a spacious
garden, now overrun with brambles and weeds. A&nbsp;few <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ’medical’ 1870 ’medicinal’">medinical</ins>
and odoriferous herbs were scattered here and there, and a few solitary
flowers overtopped the tangling briars below; but there was plenty of
fruit on the shrubbery and trees. The <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ’outbuildings’">out buildings</ins> were generally in a ruinous
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’condition’">situation</ins>. The
cemetery was the most perfect, as it was built of hewn stone and marble,
and had best withstood the ravages of time. The rooms in the house were
mostly empty and decaying: the main building was firm and strong, as was
also the extended wall which enclosed the whole. She found that although
her aunt, when they first arrived, had led her through several upper
rooms to the chamber <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’she’">they</ins> inhabited, yet there was from thence a direct passage
to the hall.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<p>The prospect was not disagreeable. West, all was wilderness, <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ’from a brook which’">from which a
brook</ins> wound along a little distance from the garden wall. North,
were the uneven grounds <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">which</ins> she had crossed when she came there, bounded by
distant groves and hills. East, beautiful meadows and fields, arrayed in
flowery green, sloped to <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">the</ins> salt marshes or sandy banks of the Sound, or ended in
the long white beaches which extended far into the sea. South, was the
Sound <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’and’">of</ins> Long Island.
<!-- well, thank god it wasn’t disagreeable; heaven forbid she be held
captive in a barren desert somewhere --></p>

<p>Melissa passed much <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">of
her</del> time in tracing the ruins of this antiquated place, in viewing
the white sails as they passed up and down the Sound, and in listening
to the songs of the thousand various birds which frequented the garden
and the forest. She could have been contented here to have buried <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">all</ins> her afflictions, and for
ever to retire from the world, could Alonzo but have resided within
those walls. “What will he think has become of me,” she would say, while
the disconsolate tear <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">of
reflection</ins> glittered in her eye. Her aunt had frequently urged her
to yield to her father’s injunctions, regain her liberty, and marry
Beauman; and she every day <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ’become’">became</ins> more solicitous and <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ’importunate’">impertinent</ins>. A&nbsp;subject so hateful to
Melissa sometimes provoked her to tears; at <ins class = "change" title
= "1804/11/70 ’others’">other</ins> her keen resentment. She therefore,
when the
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
weather was fair, passed much of her time in the garden and adjoining
walks, wishing to be as much out of her aunt’s company as possible.</p>

<p>One day John came there early in the morning, and Melissa’s aunt went
home with him. The day passed away, but she did not return. Melissa sat
up until a late <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘hour’ 1811 ‘hour in the night’">hour of the night</ins>, expecting her; she <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">then</ins> went to the gate, and found it
was fast locked, returned, locked and bolted the doors of the house,
went to bed and slept as soundly as she had done since her residence in
the old mansion. “I&nbsp;have at least, she said, escaped the disgusting
curtain-lecture about marrying Beauman.”</p>

<p>The next day her aunt returned. “I was quite concerned about you,
child, said she; how did you sleep?” “Never better, she answered, since
I have been here.” “I&nbsp;had forgotten, said her aunt, that my rents
<ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ’became’">become</ins> due this
week. I&nbsp;was detained until late by some of my tenants; John was
out, and I dare not return in the night alone. I&nbsp;must go back
to-day. It will take me a week to settle my business. If I am obliged to
stay out again I will send one of John’s daughters to sleep with
you.”<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“You need not give
yourself that trouble, replied Melissa; I&nbsp;am under no apprehension
of staying here alone; nothing can get
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
into or out of these premises.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span><ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing">“Well</ins>, thou hast wonderful courage, child, said her
aunt; but I shall be as frequently here as possible, and as soon as my
business is settled, I&nbsp;shall be absent no more.” So saying, she
bade Melissa good morning, and set off for her residence at the dwelling
of John.</p>

<p>She did not return in two days. The second night of her absence,
Melissa was sitting in her chamber reading, when she heard a noise <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">as</del> of several people
trampling in the yard below. She arose, cautiously raised the window,
and looked out. It was extremely dark; <ins class = "other" title =
"1804 only">she could discern nothing. All was still and</ins> she
thought she might have been <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’deceived’">discovered</ins>.</p>

<p>Her aunt came the next day, and told her she was obliged to go into
the country to collect some debts of those to whom she had rented <ins
class = "other" title = "1870 only">some</ins> lands: she should be gone
a few days, and as soon as she returned should come there. “The keys of
the house, said she, I&nbsp;shall leave with you. The gate I shall lock,
and leave <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ’the’">that</ins> key with
John, who will come here as often as necessary, to assist you, and see
if you want any thing.” She then went off, leaving Melissa not
dissatisfied with the prospect of her absence.</p>

<p>Melissa amused herself in evenings by reading in the few books her
aunt had brought there, and in the day <ins class = "other" title =
"1804 only">time</ins>, in walking around the yard and garden, or in
traversing
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
the rooms of the antique building. In some, were the remains of ancient
furniture, others were entirely empty. Cobwebs and mouldering walls were
the principal ornaments left.</p>

<p>One evening as she was about retiring to rest, she thought she heard
the same trampling noise in the yard, as on a former occasion. She
stepped softly to the window, suddenly raised it, and held out the
candle. <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">She fancied she saw the
glimpse of two or three dark forms pass swiftly along, but so
indistinctly that it was impossible to determine whether they were real,
or only shadows produced by objects intervening the light of the
candle.</ins> She listened and gazed with anxious solicitude, but
discovered nothing more. All was <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’still’">silent</ins>; she shut the window, and in a short time went to
bed.</p>

<p>Some time in the night she was suddenly awakened by a sharp sound,
apparently near her. She started in a trembling panic, but endeavoured
to compose herself with the idea, that something had fallen from the
shelves. As she lay musing upon the incident, she heard <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">loud</del> noises in the rooms below,
succeeded by an irregular and confused number of voices, and presently
after, footsteps ascending the stairs which led to her chamber. She
trembled; a&nbsp;cold chilly sweat <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’ran’">run</ins> down her face. Directly the doors below opened and shut
with a quick and violent motion. And soon after she was convinced that
she distinctly heard a whispering in her room. She raised herself up in
the bed and cast inquisitive eyes
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
towards her chamber door. All was darkness&mdash;no new object was
visible&mdash;no sound was heard, and she again lay down.</p>

<p>Her mind was too much agitated and alarmed to sleep. She had
evidently heard sounds, footsteps and voices in the house, and
whisperings which appeared to be in her room. The yard gate was locked,
of which John had the key. She was confident that no person could ascend
or get over the wall of the enclosure. But if that were practicable, how
was it possible that any human being could enter the house? She had the
key of every door, and they were all fast locked, and yet she had heard
them furiously open and shut. A&nbsp;thought darted into her
mind,&mdash;was it not a plan which her aunt had contrived in order to
frighten her <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’into’">to</ins> a
compliance with her wishes? But then how could she enter the house
without keys? This might be done with the use of a false key. But from
whence did the whisperings proceed, which appeared close to her bedside?
Possibly it might be conveyed through the key-hole of her chamber door.
These thoughts tended in some degree, to allay her fears;&mdash;they
were possibilities, at least, however improbable.</p>

<p>As she lay thus musing, a hand, cold as the icy fingers of death,
grasped her arm,
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
which lay <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">on the</del> outside
of the bed clothes. She screamed convulsively, and sprang up in the bed.
Nothing was to be seen&mdash;no noise was heard. She had not time to
reflect. She flew out of <del class = "other"
title = "1804 omits">the</del> bed, ran to the fire, and lighted a candle. Her heart
beat rapidly. She cast timid glances around the room, cautiously
searching every corner, and examining the door. All things were in the
same state she had left them when she went to bed. Her door was locked
in the same manner; no visible being was in the room except herself<ins
class = "change"
title = "1870 ’; how then could she account for these events?’">. She sat down, pondering on these strange events.</ins> Was
it not <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ’possible’">probable</ins>
that she was right in her first conjectures respecting their being the
works of her aunt, and effected by her agents and instrumentality? All
were possible, except the cold hand which had grasped her arm. Might not
this be the effect of a terrified and heated imagination? <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">Or if false keys had been made use of to
enter the rooms below, might they not also be used to enter her
chamber?</del> But could her room be unlocked, <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ’a person’">persons</ins> enter, approach her bed, depart
and re-lock the door, while she was awake, without her hearing them?</p>

<p>She knew she could not <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">go
to</del> sleep, and she determined not to go to bed again that night.
She took up a book, but her spirits had been too much disordered by the
past
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
scenes to permit her to read. She looked out of the window. The moon had
arisen and cast a pale<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">,
imperfect</ins> lustre over the landscape. She recollected the opening
and shutting of the door&mdash;perhaps they were still <ins class =
"correction" title = ". invisible">open.</ins> The thought was
alarming&mdash;She opened her chamber door, and with the candle in her
hand, cautiously descended the stairs, casting an inquisitive eye in
every direction, and stopping frequently to listen.&mdash;She advanced
to the door; it was locked. She examined the others; they were <ins
class = "other" title = "1870 only">all</ins> in the same situation. She
turned to go up stairs, when a loud whisper echoed through the hall
expressing “<i>away! away!</i>” She flew like lightning to her chamber,
relocked the door and flung herself, almost breathless, into a
chair.</p>

<p>As soon as her scattered senses <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">were</ins> collected, she concluded that <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘whoever’">whatever</ins> had been in the house <ins class
= "change" title = "1804 ‘were’">was</ins> there still. She resolved to
go out no more until day, which soon began to discolour the east with a
fainter blue, then purple streaks, intermingled with a dusky whiteness,
ascended in <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘pyramidal’ 1811 ‘pyramidial’">pyramidical</ins> columns <ins class = "correction" title
= "1851 omits ‘to’">to the</ins> zenith; these fading slowly away, the
eastern horizon became fringed with the golden spangles of early morn.
A&nbsp;<ins class = "other" title = "1804/11">small</ins> spot of
ineffable brightness succeeded, and immediately the sun burst over the
verge
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
of creation, deluging the world in a flood of unbounded light and
glory.</p>

<p>As soon as the morning had a little advanced, Melissa ventured out.
She proceeded with hesitating steps, carefully scrutinizing every object
which met her sight. She examined every door; they were all fast. She
critically searched every room, closet, &amp;c. above and below. She
then took a light and descended into the cellar&mdash;here her
inquisition was the same. Thus did she thoroughly and strictly examine
and search every part of the house from the garret to the cellar, but
could find nothing altered, changed, or removed; no outlet, no signs of
there having been any being in the house the evening before, except
herself.</p>

<p>She then unlocked the outer door and proceeded to the gate, which she
found locked as usual. She next examined the yard, the garden, and all
the out houses.</p>

<p>Nothing could be discovered of any person having been recently there.
She next walked around by the wall, the whole circle of the enclosure.
She was convinced that the unusual height of the wall rendered it
impossible for any one to get over it. It was constructed of several
tier of hewed timbers, and both sides of it were <del class = "other"
title = "1804 omits">as</del> smooth as glass. On the top, long spikes
were thickly driven in, sharpened at both ends. <!-- pointy sticks!
hurrah! -->
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
It was surrounded on the outside by a deep wide moat, which was nearly
filled with water. Over this moat was a draw-bridge, on the road leading
to the gate, which was drawn up, and John had the key.</p>

<p>The events of the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘last’">past</ins> night, therefore, remained inscrutable. It must be
that her aunt was the agent who had managed this extraordinary
machinery.</p>

<p>She found John at the house when she returned. “Does madam want any
thing to-day?” asked he. “Has my aunt returned?” enquired Melissa. “Not
yet,” he replied. “How long has she been gone?” she asked. “Four days,
replied John, after counting his fingers, and she will not be back under
four or five more.” “Has the key of the gate been constantly in your
possession?” asked she. “The <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘keys’">key</ins> of the gate and draw-bridge, he replied, have not been
out of my possession for a moment since your aunt has been gone.” “Has
any person been to enquire for me or my aunt, she enquired, since I have
been here?”&mdash;“No, madam, said he, not a single person.” Melissa
knew not what to think; she could not give up the idea of false
keys&mdash;perhaps her aunt had returned to her father’s.&mdash;Perhaps
the draw-bridge had been let down, the gate opened, and the house
entered <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘by the means of false keys’ 1870 ‘by false keys’">by means of false keys</ins>. Her father would as
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
soon do this as <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">to</del>
confine her in this solitary place; and he would go all lengths to
induce her, either by terror, persuasion or threats, to relinquish
Alonzo and marry Beauman.</p>

<p>A thought impressed her mind which gave her some consolation. It was
possible to secure the premises so that no <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ‘one’">person</ins> could enter even by the aid of false keys. She
asked John if he would assist her that day. “In anything you wish,
madam,” he replied. She then directed him to go to work. Staples and
iron bars were found in different parts of the building, with which he
secured the doors and windows, so that they could be opened only on the
inside. The gate, which swung in, was secured in the same manner. She
then asked John if he was willing to leave the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘keys’">key</ins> of the gate and <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the</del> draw-bridge with her. “Perhaps I may as
well,” said he; “for if you bar the gate and let down the bridge,
I&nbsp;cannot get in myself until you let me in.” John handed her the
keys. “When I come,” said he, “I&nbsp;will halloo, and you must let me
in.” This she promised to do, and John departed.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagC" id = "tagC" href = "#noteC">*</a></p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteC" id = "noteC" href = "#tagC">*</a>
Of the place where Melissa was confined, as described in the foregoing
pages, scarce a trace now remains. By the events of the revolution, the
premises fell into other hands. The mansion, out houses and walls were
torn down, the cemetery levelled, the moat filled up; the locusts and
elm trees were cut down; all obstructions were removed, and the yard and
garden converted into a beautiful meadow. An elegant farm-house is now
erected on the place where John’s hut then stood and the neighbourhood
is thinly settled.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>

<p>That night Melissa let down the bridge,
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
locked and barred the gate, and the doors and windows of the house: she
also went again over all parts of the building, strictly searching every
place, though she was well convinced she should find nothing
extra&shy;ordinary. She then retired to her chamber, seated herself at
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘the’">a</ins> western window, and
watched the slow declining sun, as it leisurely sunk behind the lofty
groves. Pensive twilight spread her misty mantle over the landscape; the
western horizon glowed with the spangles of evening. Deepening glooms
advanced. The last beam of day faded from the view, and the world was
enveloped in night. The owl hooted solemnly in the forest, and the
whippoorwill sung cheerfully in the garden. <ins class = "change" title
= "1804 ‘Innumerous’">Innumerable</ins> stars glittered in the
firmament, intermingling their quivering lustre with the pale splendours
of the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘milkyway’ 1811 ‘milk way’">milky way</ins>.</p>

<p>Melissa did not retire from the window until late; she then shut it
and withdrew within the room. She determined not to go to bed that
night. If she was to be visited by beings, material or immaterial, she
chose not again to encounter them in darkness, or to be surprised when
she was
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
asleep. But why should she fear? <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">She knew of no one she had injured.</ins> She knew of none she had
displeased except her father, her aunt and Beauman. If by any of <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘these’">those</ins> the late terrifying
scenes had been wrought, she had now effectually precluded a recurrence
thereof, for she was well convinced that no human being could now enter
the enclosure without her permission. But if supernatural agents had
been the actors, what had she to fear from them? The night passed away
without any alarming circumstances, and when daylight appeared she flung
herself upon the bed, and slept until <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the</del> morning was considerably advanced. She now felt
convinced that her former conjectures were right; that it was her aunt,
her father, or both, who had caused the alarming sounds she had heard,
a&nbsp;repetition of which had only been prevented by the precautions
she had taken.</p>

<p>When she awoke, the horizon was overclouded, and it <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘had begun’">began</ins> to rain. It continued to
rain until towards evening, when it cleared away. She went to the gate,
and found all things as she had left them: She returned, fastened the
doors as usual, examined all parts of the house, and again went <ins
class = "correction"
title = "missing lines supplied from other editions">to her chamber.</ins></p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "missing lines supplied from other editions">She sat up until a late hour, when grow</ins>ing very drowsy,
and convinced that she was safe and secure, she <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘concluded to go’">went</ins> to bed; leaving,
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
however, <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">two</del> candles
burning in the room. As she, for two nights, had been deprived of her
<del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">usual</del> rest, she soon
fell into a slumber.</p>

<p>She had not long been asleep before she was suddenly aroused by the
apparent report of a pistol, seemingly discharged close to her head.
Awakened so instantaneously, her recollection, for a time, was confused
and imperfect. She was only sensible of a strong, sulphureous scent: but
she soon remembered that she had left two candles burning, and every
object was now shrouded in darkness. This alarmed her exceedingly. What
could have become of the candles? They must have been blown out or taken
away. What was the sound she had just heard?<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>What the sulphureous stench which had
pervaded the room?<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>While she
was thus musing in perplexity, a&nbsp;broad flash like <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">that of</ins> lightning, transiently
illuminated <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘her’">the</ins>
chamber, followed by a long, loud, and deep roar, which seemed to shake
the building to its centre. It did not appear like thunder; the <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘sound’">sounds</ins> seemed to be in the
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘room’">rooms</ins> directly over
her head. Perhaps, however, it was thunder.</p>

<p>Perhaps a preceding clap had struck near the building, broken the
windows, put out the lights, and filled the house with <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">the</del> electric effluvium. She listened
for a repetition
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
of the thunder&mdash;but a very different sound <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">soon</del> grated on her ear. A&nbsp;hollow,
horrible groan echoed through her apartment, passing off in a faint
dying murmur. It was evident that the groan proceeded from some person
in the chamber. Melissa raised herself up in <del class = "other" title
= "1870 omits">the</del> bed; a&nbsp;tall white form moved from the
upper end of the room, glided slowly by her bed, and seemed to pass off
near the foot. She then heard the doors below alternately open and shut,
<ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘flapping’ [see end of text]">slapping</ins> furiously, and in quick succession, followed by
violent noises in the rooms below, like the falling of heavy bodies and
the crash of furniture. Clamorous voices succeeded, among which she
could distinguish boisterous menaces and threatenings, and the plaintive
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘tones’">tone</ins> of
expostulation.&mdash;A momentary silence ensued, when the cry of
“<i>Murder! murder! murder!!</i>” echoed through the building, followed
by the report of a pistol, and shortly after, the groans of a person
apparently in the agonies of death, which grew fainter and fainter until
it died away in a seemingly expiring gasp. A&nbsp;dead silence prevailed
for a few minutes, to which a loud hoarse peal of ghastly laughter
succeeded&mdash;then again all was still. But she soon heard heavy
footsteps ascending the stairs to her chamber door. It was now she
became terrified and
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
alarmed beyond any former example.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Gracious heaven, defend me! she exclaimed;
what am I coming to!” Knowing that every avenue to the enclosure was
effectually secured; knowing that all the doors and windows of the
house, as also that which opened into her chamber, were fast locked,
strictly bolted and barred; and knowing that all the keys were in her
possession, she could not entertain the least doubt but the noises she
had heard were produced by supernatural beings, and, she had reason to
believe, of the most mischievous nature. She was now convinced that her
father or her aunt could have no agency in the business. She even wished
her aunt had returned. It must be exceedingly difficult to cross the
moat, as the draw bridge was up; it must be still more difficult to <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘pass’">surpass</ins> the wall of the
enclosure; it was impossible for any human being to enter the house, and
still more impossible to enter <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘the’">her</ins> chamber.</p>

<p>While she lay thus ruminating in extreme agitation, momentarily
expecting to have her ears assailed with some terrific sound,
a&nbsp;pale light dimly illuminated her chamber. It grew brighter. She
raised herself up to look towards the door;&mdash;the first object which
met her eye, was a most horrible form, standing at a little distance
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
from her bedside. Its appearance was tall <ins class = "correction"
title = "‘a’ invisible">and</ins> robust, wrapped in a tattered white
<ins class = "correction" title = "‘r’ invisible">robe</ins>, spotted
with blood. The hair of its head was matted with clotted gore.
A&nbsp;deep wound appeared to have pierced its breast, from which fresh
blood flowed down its garment. Its pale face was gashed and gory! its
eyes fixed, glazed, and glaring;&mdash;its lips open, its teeth set, and
in its hand was a bloody dagger.</p>

<p>Melissa, uttering a shriek of terror, shrunk into the bed, and in an
instant the room was involved in pitchy darkness. A&nbsp;freezing ague
seized her limbs, and drops of chilling sweat stood upon her face.
Immediately a horrid hoarse voice burst from amidst the gloom of her
apartment, “<i>Begone! begone from this house!</i>” The bed on which she
lay then seemed to be agitated, and directly she perceived some person
crawling on <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">to</ins> its foot.
Every consideration, except present safety, was relinquished; <ins class
= "change" title = "1870 ‘instantly’">instantaneously</ins> she sprang
from the bed to the floor&mdash;with <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘convulsive’">convulsed</ins> grasp, seized the candle, flew to the fire
and lighted it. She gazed wildly around the room&mdash;no new object was
visible. With timid step she approached the bed; she strictly searched
all around and under it, but nothing strange could be found.
A&nbsp;thought darted into her mind to leave the house immediately and
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
fly to John’s: this was easy, as the keys of the gate and draw-bridge
were in her possession. She stopped not to reconsider her determination,
but seizing the keys, with the candle in her hand, she unlocked her
chamber door, and proceeded cautiously down stairs, fearfully casting
her eyes on each side, as she tremblingly advanced to the outer door.
She hesitated a moment. To what perils was she about to expose herself,
by thus venturing out at the dead of <del class = "other" title =
"1804/70 omit">the</del> night, and proceeding such a distance alone?
Her situation she thought could become no more hazardous, and she was
about to unbar the door, when she <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘heard’">was alarmed by</ins> a deep, hollow sigh. She looked around and
saw, stretched on one side of the hall, the same ghastly form which had
so recently appeared standing <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘at’">by</ins> her bedside. The same haggard countenance, the same awful
appearance of murderous death. A&nbsp;faintness came upon her; she
turned to flee to her chamber&mdash;the candle dropped from her
trembling hand, and she was shrouded in impenetrable darkness. She
groped to find the stairs: as she came near <ins class = "change" title
= "1870 ‘the’">their</ins> foot, a&nbsp;black object, apparently in
human shape, stood before her, with eyes which seemed to burn like coals
of fire, and red flames issuing from its mouth. As she stood fixed a
moment in inexpressible trepidation,
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
a large ball of fire rolled along the hall, towards the door, and burst
with an explosion which seemed to rock the building to its deepest
foundation. Melissa closed her eyes and sunk senseless to the floor. She
revived and got to her chamber, she hardly knew how; locked her door,
lighted another candle, and after again searching the room, flung
herself into a chair, in a state of mind which almost deprived her of
reason.</p>

<p>Daylight soon appeared, and the cheerful sun darting its enlivening
rays through the crevices and windows of the antique mansion, recovered
her exhausted spirits, and dissipated, in some degree, the terrors which
hovered about her mind. She endeavoured to reason coolly on the events
of the past night, but reason could not elucidate them. Not the least
noise had been heard since she <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">last</del> returned to her chamber: she therefore expected to
discover no traits which might tend to a disclosure of <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘these’">those</ins> mysteries. She consoled
herself only with a fixed determination to leave the desolate mansion.
Should John come there that day, he might be prevailed on to permit her
to remain at her aunt’s apartment in his house until her aunt should
return. If he should not come before sunset, she resolved to leave the
mansion and proceed there.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<p>She took some <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘refreshments’">refreshment</ins> and went down stairs: she found the
doors and windows all fast as she had left them. She then again searched
every room in the house, both above and below, and the cellar; but she
discovered no appearance of there having been any person there. Not the
smallest article was displaced; every thing appeared as it <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘formerly had’">had formerly</ins>
been.&mdash;She then went to the gate; it was locked as usual, and the
draw-bridge <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">was</del> up. She
again traversed the circuit of the wall, but found no alteration, or any
place where it was possible the enclosure might be entered. Again she
visited the <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘out-buildings’">outer
buildings</ins>, and even entered the cemetery, but discovered not the
least circumstance which could conduce to explain the surprising
transactions of the preceding night. She however returned to her room in
a more composed frame of spirit, confident that she should not remain
alone another night in that gloomy, desolate, and dangerous
solitude.</p>

<p>Towards evening Melissa took <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘a’">her usual</ins> walk around the enclosure. It was that season of
the year when weary summer is lapsing into the arms of fallow
autumn.&mdash;The day had been warm, and the light gales bore <ins class
= "change" title = "1870 ‘invigorating’">revigorating</ins> coolness on
their wings as they tremulously agitated the foliage of the western
forest, or fluttered among the
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
branches of <del class = "other" title = "1804/11 omit">the</del> trees
surrounding the mansion. The green splendours of spring had <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘began’">begun</ins> to fade into a yellow
lustre, the flowery verdure of the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘field’">fields</ins> <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘were changing’">was changed</ins> to a russet hue. A&nbsp;robin chirped on a
neighbouring oak, a&nbsp;wren chattered beneath, swallows twittered
around the decayed buildings, the ludicrous mocking bird sung sportively
from the top of the highest elm and the surrounding groves rung with
varying, artless melody;<!-- he would know from artless --> while deep
in the adjacent wilderness the woodcock, hammering on <ins class =
"change"
title = "1804 ‘the hollow trunk of some dry and blasted tree’">some dry and blasted trees</ins>, filled the woods with <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘reverberating’">reverberant</ins>
echoes. The Sound was only ruffled by the lingering breezes, as they
idly wandered over its surface. Long Island, now in possession of the
British troops, was thinly enveloped in smoky vapour; scattered along
its shores lay the numerous small craft and larger ships of the hostile
fleet. A&nbsp;few skiffs were passing and repassing the Sound, and
several American gun-boats lay off a point which jutted out from the
main land, far to the eastward. Numberless summer insects mingled their
discordant strains amidst the weedy herbage. A&nbsp;heavy black cloud
was rising in the north west, which seemed to portend a shower, as the
sonorous, distant thunder was at long intervals distinctly heard.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<p>Melissa walked around the yard, contemplating the varying beauties of
the scene: the images of <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘departing’">departed</ins> joys&mdash;the days when Alonzo had
participated with her in admiring the splendours of rural prospects,
raised in her bosom the sigh of deep regret. She entered the garden and
traversed the alleys, now overgrown with weeds and tufted knot-grass.
The flower beds were choaked with <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the</del> low running bramble and tangling five-finger; tall,
rank rushes, mullens and daisies, had usurped the empire of the kitchen
garden. The viny arbour was broken, and principally gone to decay; yet
the “lonely wild rose” blushed mournfully amidst the ruins. As she
passed from the garden she involuntarily stopped at the cemetery: she
paused in serious reflection:&mdash;“Here, said she, in this house of
gloom <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘rests’">rest</ins>, in
undisturbed silence, my honourable ancestors, once the active tenants of
yonder mansion. Then, throughout these <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">now</ins> solitary demesnes, the busy occurrences of life
glided in cheerful circles. Then, these now moss-clad alleys, and this
wild weedy garden, were the resort of the fashionable and the gay. Then,
evening music floated over the fields, while yonder halls and apartments
shone <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘with’">in</ins> brilliant
illumination. Now all is sad, solitary and dreary, the haunt of <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ‘sprites’">spirits</ins> and spectres of
nameless terror. All
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
that now remains of the head that formed, <ins class = "other" title =
"1870 only">and</ins> the hand that executed, and the bosom that
relished this once happy scenery, is now, alas, only a heap of
dust.”</p>

<p>She seated herself on a little hillock, under a weeping willow, which
stood near the cemetery, and watched the rising shower, which <ins class
= "other" title = "1804/11">slowly</ins> ascended in gloomy pomp, half
hidden behind the western groves, shrouding the low sun in black vapour,
while coming thunders more nearly and more awfully rolled. The shrieking
night hawk<a class = "tag" name = "tagD" id = "tagD" href =

<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteD" id = "noteD" href = "#tagD">*</a>
Supposed to be the male whippoorwill; well known in the New-England

soared high into the air, mingling with the lurid van of <del class =
"other" title = "1811 omits">the</del> approaching storm, which
widening, <ins class = "correction" title = "1851 ‘nore’">more</ins>
rapidly advanced, until “the heavens were arrayed in blackness.”</p>

<p>The lightning <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">more</ins>
broader and brighter <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘flashed’">flashes</ins>, hurling down its forky streaming bolts <!--
forky streaming bolts? excellent --> far in the wilderness, its flaming
path followed by the vollying artillery of the skies. Now bending its
long, crinkling spires over the vallies, now glimmering along the summit
of the hills. Convolving clouds <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘pouring’">poured</ins> smoky volumes through the expansion;
a&nbsp;deep, hollow, distant roar, announced the approach of “summoned
winds.” The whole forest bowed in awful grandeur, as from its dark bosom
rushed the impetuous hurricane, twisting off, or tearing up
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
by the roots, the stoutest trees, whirling the heaviest branches through
the air with irresistible fury. It dashed upon the sea, tossed it into
irregular mountains, or mingled its white foamy spray with the gloom of
the turbid skies. <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘Slantways’">Slant-wise</ins>, the large heavy drops of rain began to
descend. Melissa hastened to the mansion; as she reached the door a very
brilliant flash of lightning, accompanied by a tremendous explosion,
alarmed her. A&nbsp;thunder bolt had entered a large elm tree within the
enclosure, and with <del class = "other" title = "1804/11 omit">a</del>
horrible crash, had shivered it from top to bottom. She unlocked the
door and hurried to her chamber. Deep night now filled the atmosphere;
the rain poured in torrents, the wind rocked the building, and bellowed
in the adjacent groves: the sea raged and roared, fierce lightnings rent
the heavens, alternately involving the world in the sheeted flame of its
many coloured fires; thunders rolled awfully around the firmament, or
burst with horrid din, bounding and reverberating among the surrounding
woods, hills and <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘valleys’">vallies</ins>. It seemed nothing less than the <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ‘crush’">crash</ins> of worlds sounding
through the universe.</p>

<p>Melissa walked her room, listening to the wild commotion of the
elements. She feared that if the storm continued, she should
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
be compelled to pass another night in the <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/11 ‘lonely’">lone</ins> mansion: if so, she resolved not to go to
bed. She now suddenly recollected that in her haste to regain her
chamber, she had forgotten to lock the outer door. The shock she had
received when the lightning demolished the elm tree, was the cause of
this neglect. She took the candle, ran hastily down, and fastened the
door. As she was returning, she heard footsteps, and imperfectly saw the
glance of something coming out of an adjoining room into the hall.
Supposing some ghastly object was approaching, she averted her eyes and
flew to the stairs. As she was ascending them, a&nbsp;voice <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">behind her</del> exclaimed, “Gracious
heaven! Melissa!” The voice agitated her frame with a confused,
sympathetic sensation. She turned, fixed her eyes upon the person who
had spoken; unconnected ideas floated a moment in her imagination:
“Eternal powers! she cried, it is Alonzo.”</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>

<p>Alonzo and Melissa were equally surprised at so unexpected a meeting.
They could scarcely credit their own senses.&mdash;How he had discovered
her solitude&mdash;what led him to that lonely place&mdash;how he had
got over the wall&mdash;were queries which first arose in her mind. He
likewise could not conceive by what miracle he should find her in a
remote, desolate building, which
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
he had supposed to be uninhabited. With rapture he took her trembling
hand; tears of joy choaked their utterance. “You are wet, Alonzo, said
Melissa at length; we will go up to my chamber; I&nbsp;have a fire
there, where you can dry your clothes.”&mdash;“Your chamber; replied
Alonzo; who then inhabits this house?” “No one except myself<ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">, Alonzo</ins>, she answered; I&nbsp;am here
alone, Alonzo.” “Alone! he exclaimed&mdash;here alone, Melissa! Good
God! tell me how&mdash;why&mdash;by what means are you here alone?” “Let
us go up to my chamber, she replied, and I will tell you all.”</p>

<p>He followed her <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">up</ins> to
her apartment and seated himself by the fire. “You want refreshment,”
said Melissa&mdash;which was indeed the case, as he had been long
without any, and was wet, hungry and weary.</p>

<p>She immediately set about preparing tea and soon had it ready, and a
comfortable repast was spread for his entertainment.&mdash;And now,
reader, if thou art a child of nature, if thy bosom is susceptible of
refined sensibility, contemplate for a moment, Melissa and Alonzo seated
at the same table, a&nbsp;table prepared by her own hand, in a lonely
mansion, separated from society, and no one <ins class = "other" title =
"1804 only">present</ins> to interrupt them. After innumerable
difficulties, troubles and perplexities; after vexing embarrassments,
and a cruel separation,
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
they were once more together, and for some time every other
consideration was lost. The violence of the storm had not abated. The
lightning still blazed, the thunder bellowed, the wind roared, the sea
raged, the rain poured, mingled with heavy hail: Alonzo and Melissa
heard <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘little’ 1870 ‘but little’">a little</ins> of it. She told him all that had happened to her
since they parted, except the strange noises and awful sights which had
terrified her during her confinement in that solitary building: this she
considered unnecessary and untimely, in her present situation.</p>

<p>Alonzo informed her, that as soon as he had learned the manner in
which she had been sent away, he left the house of Vincent and went to
her father’s to see if he could not find out by some of the domestics
what course her aunt <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">and
she</ins> had taken. None of them knew any thing about it. He did not
put himself in the way of her father, as he was apprehensive of ill
treatment thereby. He then went to several places among the relatives of
the family where he had heretofore visited with Melissa, most of whom
received him with a cautious coldness. At length he came to the house of
Mr. Simpson, the gentleman to whose seat Alonzo was once driven by a
shower, where he accidentally found Melissa on a visit, as mentioned
before<ins class = "other" title = "1811 only">*</ins>.
<span class = "footnote lost">
<ins class = "other" title = "1811 only [pg26 = 1851 pg35]">* See page
26.</ins>
</span>
Here he was admitted
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
with the ardour of friendship. They had heard his story: Melissa had
kept up a correspondence with one of the young ladies; they were
therefore informed of all, except Melissa’s removal from her father’s
house: of this they knew nothing until told thereof by Alonzo.</p>

<p>“I am surprised at the conduct of my kinsman, said Mr. Simpson; for
though his determinations are, like the laws of the Medes and Persians,
unalterable, yet I have ever believed that the welfare of his children
lay nearest his heart. In the present instance he is certainly pursuing
a mistaken policy. I&nbsp;will go and see him.” He then ordered his
horse, desiring Alonzo to remain <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">at his house</del> until he returned.</p>

<p>Alonzo was treated with the most friendly politeness by the family;
he found that they were deeply interested in his <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘affairs’">favour</ins> and <ins class = "other" title =
"1870 only">in</ins> the welfare of Melissa. At evening Mr. Simpson
returned. “It is in vain, said he, to reason with my kinsman; he is
determined that his daughter shall marry your rival. He will not even
inform me to what place he has sent Melissa. Her aunt however is with
her, and they must be at the residence of some of the family
relatives.&mdash;I will dispatch my son William among our connections,
to see if he can find her out.”</p>

<p>The next morning William departed, and
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
was gone two days; but could not obtain the least intelligence either of
Melissa or her aunt, although he had been the rounds among the relations
of the family.</p>

<p>“There is some mystery in this affair, said Mr. Simpson. I&nbsp;am
very little acquainted with Melissa’s aunt. I&nbsp;have understood that
she draws a decent support from her patrimonial resources, which, it is
said, are pretty large, and that she resides alternately with her
different relatives. I&nbsp;have understood also that my kinsman expects
her fortune to come into his family, in case she never marries, which,
in all probability, she now will not, and that she, in consequence,
holds considerable influence over him. It is <ins class = "change" title
= "1804 ‘possible’">not possible but</ins> that Melissa is yet concealed
at some place of her aunt’s residence, and that the family are in the
secret. I&nbsp;think it cannot be long before they will disclose
themselves: You, Alonzo, are welcome to make my house your home; and if
Melissa can be found, she shall be treated as my daughter.”</p>

<p>Alonzo thanked him for his friendship and fatherly kindness.
“I&nbsp;must continue, said he, my researches for Melissa; the result
you shall know.”</p>

<p>He then departed, and travelled through the neighbouring villages and
adjoining
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
neighbourhoods, making, at almost every house, such enquiries as he
considered necessary on the occasion. He at length arrived at the inn in
the last little village where Melissa and her aunt had stopped the day
they came to the mansion. Here the inn-keeper informed him that two
ladies, answering his description, had been at his house: he named the
time, which was the day in which Melissa, with her aunt, left her
father’s house. The inn-keeper told him that they purchased some
articles in the village, and drove off to the south. Alonzo then
traversed the country adjoining the Sound, far to the westward, and <del
class = "other" title = "1811 omits">was</del> returning eastward, when
he was overtaken by the shower. No house being within sight, <ins class
= "correction" title = "1851 ‘be’">he</ins> betook himself to the forest
for shelter. From a little hilly glade in the wilderness, he discovered
the lonely mansion which, from its appearance, he very naturally
supposed to be uninhabited.&mdash;The tempest soon becoming severe, he
thought he would endeavour to reach the house.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the moat, he found it impossible to cross it, or
ascend the wall; and he stood in momentary jeopardy of his life, from
the falling timber, some of which was broken and torn up by the tornado,
<del class = "other" title = "1804/11 omit">and</del> some splintered by
the fiery bolts of heaven.
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
At length a large<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">, tall</ins>
tree, which stood near him, on the verge of the moat, or rather in that
place<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">, river</ins>, was hurled
from its foundation, and fell, with a hideous crash, across the moat,
its top lodging on the wall. He scrambled up on the trunk, and made his
way on <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">to</ins> the wall. By
the incessant glare of lightning he was able to see distinctly. The top
of the tree was partly broken by the force of its fall, and hung down
the other side of the wall. By these branches he let himself down into
the yard, proceeded to the house, found the door open, which Melissa had
left <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">so</ins> in her fright,
and entered into one of the rooms, where he proposed to stay until at
least the shower was over, still supposing the house unoccupied, until
the noise of locking the door, and the light of the candle, drew him
from the room, when, to his infinite surprise, he discovered Melissa, as
before related.</p>

<p>Melissa listened to Alonzo with varied emotion. The fixed obduracy of
her father, the generous conduct of the Simpsons, the constancy of
Alonzo, filled her heart with inexpressible sensations. She foresaw that
her sufferings were not shortly to end&mdash;she knew not when her
sorrows were to close.</p>

<p>Alonzo was shocked at the alteration which appeared in the features
of Melissa.
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
The rose had faded from her cheek, except when it was transiently
suffused with a hectic flush. A&nbsp;livid paleness sat upon her
countenance, and her fine form was rapidly wasting. It was easy to be
foreseen that the grief which preyed upon her heart would soon destroy
her, unless speedily allayed.</p>

<p>The storm had now passed into the regions of the east; the wind and
rain had ceased, the lightning more unfrequently flashed, and the
thunder rolled at a distance. The hours passed hastily;&mdash;day would
soon appear. Hitherto they had been absorbed in the present moment; it
was time to think of the future. After the troubles they had
experienced; after so fortunate a meeting, they could not endure the
idea of another and <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">an</ins>
immediate separation. And yet immediately separated they must be. It
would not be safe for Alonzo to stay <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">there</ins> even until the rising sun, unless he was concealed;
and of what use could it be for him to remain there in concealment?</p>

<p>In this dilemma there was but one expedient. “Suffer me, said Alonzo
to Melissa, to remove you from this solitary confinement. Your health is
impaired. To you, your father is no more a father; he has steeled his
bosom to paternal affection; he
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
has banished you from his house, placed you under the tyranny of others,
and confined you in a lonely, desolate dwelling, far from the sweets of
society; and this only because you cannot heedlessly renounce a most
solemn contract, formed under his eye, and sanctioned by his immediate
consent and approbation. Pardon me, Melissa, I&nbsp;would not <ins class
= "other" title = "1804 only">wish unjustly to</ins> censure your
father; but permit me to say, that after such treatment, you are
absolved from implicit obedience to his rigorous, cruel, and stern
commands.&mdash;It will therefore be considered a duty you owe to your
preservation, if you suffer me to remove you from the tyrannical
severity with which you are oppressed.”</p>

<p>Melissa sighed, <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘wiped’">wiping</ins> a tear which fell from her eye. “Unqualified
obedience to my parents, said she, I&nbsp;have ever considered <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘one of the first’">the first of</ins>
duties, and have religiously practised thereon<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but where, Alonzo, would you remove me?” “To
any place you shall appoint,” he answered. “I&nbsp;have no where to go,”
she replied.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“If</ins> you
will allow me to name the place, said he, I&nbsp;will mention Mr.
Simpson’s. He will espouse your cause and be a father to you, and, if
conciliation is possible, will reconcile you to your father. This can be
done without my being known to have any agency in the business. It can
seem as if
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
Mr. Simpson had found you out. He will go any just lengths to serve us.
It was his desire, if you could be found, to have you brought to his
house. There you can remain either in secret or openly, as you shall
choose. Be governed by me in this, Melissa, and in all things I will
obey you thereafter. I&nbsp;will then submit to the future events of
fate; but I cannot Melissa&mdash;I cannot leave you in this doleful
place.”</p>

<p>Melissa arose and walked the room in extreme agitation. What could
she do? She had, indeed, determined to leave the house, for reasons
which Alonzo knew nothing of. <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">But should she leave it in the way she had proposed, she was not
sure but she would be immediately remanded back, more strictly guarded,
and more severely treated.</del> To continue there, under existing
circumstances, would be impossible, <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/11">and</ins> long to exist. She therefore came to a
determination&mdash;“I will go, she said, to Mr. Simpson’s.”</p>

<p>It was then agreed that Alonzo should proceed to Vincent’s, interest
them in the plan, procure a carriage, and return at eleven o’clock the
next night. Melissa was to <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘leave’">have</ins> the draw-bridge down, and the gate open. If John
should come to the house the succeeding day, she would persuade him to
let her still keep the keys. But it was possible her aunt might return.
This
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
would render the execution of the scheme more hazardous and difficult.
A&nbsp;signal was therefore agreed <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘upon’">on</ins>; if her aunt should be there, a&nbsp;candle was to be
placed at the window fronting the gate, in the room above; if not, it
was to be placed against a similar window in the room below. In the
first case Alonzo was to rap loudly at the door. Melissa was to run
down, <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘on’">under</ins> pretence of
seeing who was there, fly with Alonzo to the carriage, and leave her
aunt to scrape acquaintance with the ghosts and goblins of the old
mansion. For even if her aunt should return, which was extremely
doubtful, she thought she could contrive to let down the bridge and
unlock the gate in the evening without her knowledge. At any rate she
was determined not to let the keys go out of her hands, unless they were
forced from her, until she had escaped from that horrid and dreary
place.<!-- “Yes, we’ve come up with an elaborate, brilliant plan. What?
Leave now? You can’t be serious!” --></p>

<p>Daylight began to break from the east,<!-- that’s something of a
surprise; I’d assumed a mirror universe --> and Alonzo prepared to
depart. Melissa accompanied him to the gate and the bridge, which was
let down: <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘he passed over and slowly withdrew’">he passed over, and she slowly withdrew</ins>, both
frequently turning to look back. When she came to the gate, she
stopped;&mdash;Alonzo stopped also. She waved a white handkerchief she
had in her hand, and Alonzo bowed in answer to the sign. She then
leisurely
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
entered and slowly shut the gate.&mdash;Alonzo could not forbear
climbing up into a tree to catch another glimpse of her as she passed up
the avenue. With lingering step he saw her move along, soon receding
from his view in the gray twilight of misty morning. He then descended,
and hastily proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p>Traits of glory now painted the eastern skies. The glittering
day-star, having unbarred the portals of light, began to transmit its
retrocessive lustre. Thin scuds flew swiftly over the moon’s decrescent
form. Low, hollow winds, murmured among the bushes, or brushed the
limpid drops from intermingling foliage. The fire-fly<a class = "tag"
name = "tagE" id = "tagE" href = "#noteE">*</a>
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteE" id = "noteE" href = "#tagE">*</a>
<del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">The American lampyris,
vulgarly called the lightning-bug.</del></span>
sunk, feebly twinkling, <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘amongst’">amidst</ins> the herbage of the fields. The dusky shadows of
night fled to the deep glens, and rocky caverns of the wilderness. The
American lark soared high in the air, consecrating its matin lay to
morn’s approaching splendours. The woodlands began to ring with native
melody&mdash;the forest tops, on high mountains, caught the sun’s first
ray, which, widening and extending, soon gem’d the landscape with
brilliants of a thousand various dies.</p>

<p>As Alonzo came out of the fields near the road, he saw two persons
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘pass’">passing</ins> in an open
chair. They suddenly stopped, earnestly
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
gazing at him. They were wrapped in long riding cloaks, and it could not
be distinguished from their dress whether they were men or women. He
stood not to notice them, but made the best of his way to Vincent’s,
where he arrived about noon.&mdash;Rejoiced to find that he had
discovered Melissa, they applauded the plan of her removal, and assisted
him <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘to obtain’">in obtaining</ins>
a carriage. A&nbsp;sedan was procured, and he <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘sat’">set</ins> out to return, promising to see Vincent
again, as soon as he had removed Melissa to Mr. Simpson’s. He made such
use of his time as to arrive at the mansion at the hour appointed. He
found the draw-bridge down, the gate open, and saw, as had been agreed
upon, the light at the lower window, glimmering through the branches of
trees. He was therefore assured that Melissa was alone. His heart beat;
a&nbsp;joyful tremor seized his frame; Melissa was soon to be under his
care, for a short time at least.&mdash;He drove up to the house, sprang
out of the carriage, and fastened his horse to a locust tree: The door
was open; he went in, flew lightly up stairs, entered her
chamber&mdash;Melissa was not there! A&nbsp;small fire was blazing on
the hearth, <ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">and</ins> a candle
was burning on the table. He stood petrified with amazement, then gazed
around in anxious solicitude. What could have
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
become of her? It was impossible, he <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/11/70 ‘thought’">tho’t</ins>, but that she must still be there<ins
class = "correction" title = "1851 ‘..’">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Had she been removed by fraud or force, the signal candle would not
have been at the window. Perhaps, in a freakish moment, she had
concealed herself for no other purpose than to cause him a little
perplexity. He therefore took the candle and searched every corner of
the chamber, and every room of the house, not even missing the garret
and the cellar. He then placed the candle in a lantern, <del class =
"other" title = "1804/11 omit">and</del> went out and examined the
out-houses: he next went round the garden and the yard, strictly
exploring and investigating every place; but he found her not. He
repeatedly and loudly called her by name; he was answered only by the
solitary echoes of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Again he returned to the house, traversed the rooms, there also
calling on the name of Melissa: his voice reverberated from the walls,
dying away in solemn murmurs in the distant empty apartments. Thus did
he continue his anxious scrutiny, <ins class = "correction" title =
"1851 ‘alternately,’ (with comma)">alternately</ins> in the house and
the enclosure, until day&mdash;but no traces could be discovered,
nothing seen or heard of Melissa. What had become of her he could not
form the most distant conjecture. Nothing was removed from the house;
the beds, the chairs, the table, all the furniture remained in the
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
same condition as when he was there the night before;&mdash;the candle,
as had been agreed upon, was at the window, and another <del class =
"other" title = "1804 omits">was</del> burning on the table:&mdash;it
was therefore evident that she could not have been long gone when he
arrived. By what means <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘had she’">she had</ins> thus suddenly disappeared, was a most deep and
inscrutable mystery.</p>

<p>When the sun had arisen, he once more repeated his inquisitive
search, but with the same effect. He then, in extreme vexation and
disappointment, flung himself into the sedan, and drove from the
mansion. Frequently did he look back at the building, anxiously did he
scrutinize every surrounding and receding object. A&nbsp;thrill of
pensive recollection vibrated through his frame as he passed the gate,
and the keen agonizing pangs of blasted hope, pierced his heart, as <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘the’">his</ins> carriage rolled over the
bridge.</p>

<p>Once more he cast a “longing, lingering look” upon the premises
behind, sacred only for the treasure they lately possessed; then sunk
backward in his seat, and was dragged slowly away.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>

<p>Alonzo had understood from Melissa, that John’s hut was <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ‘situate’">situated</ins> about one mile north
from the mansion where she had been confined. When he came <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">out</del> near the road, he left his horse
and carriage, after securing them, and went in search of it.&mdash;He
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
soon discovered it, and knew it from the description given thereof by
Melissa.&mdash;He went up and knocked at the door, which was opened by
John, whom Alonzo also knew, from the portrait Melissa had drawn of
him.</p>

<p>John <ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘stared’">started</ins>
in amazement. “Understanding, said Alonzo, that you have the charge of
the old mansion in yonder field, I&nbsp;have come to know if you can
inform me what has become of the young lady who has been confined
there.”</p>

<p>“Confined! answered John, I did not know she was confined.”</p>

<p>Recollecting himself, “I mean the young lady who has lately resided
there with her aunt,” replied Alonzo.</p>

<p>“She was there last night, answered John; her aunt <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘has’">is</ins> gone into the country and has not
returned.”</p>

<p>Alonzo then told him the situation of the mansion, and that she was
not there. John informed him that <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘he’">she</ins> was there about sunset, and according to her request he
had left the keys of the gate and bridge with her: he desired Alonzo to
tarry there until he ran to the mansion.</p>

<p>He returned in <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">about</del>
half an hour. “She is gone, sure enough, said John; but how, or where,
it is impossible for me to guess.”&mdash;Convinced that he knew nothing
of the
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
matter, Alonzo left him and returned to Vincent’s.</p>

<p>Vincent and his lady were much surprised at Alonzo’s account of
Melissa’s sudden disappearance, and they wished to ascertain whether her
father’s family knew any thing of the circumstance. Social intercourse
had become suspended between the families of Vincent and Melissa’s
father, as the latter had taxed the former <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ‘with’">of</ins> improperly endeavouring to promote the views of
Alonzo. They therefore procured a neighbouring woman to visit Melissa’s
mother, to see if any information could be obtained concerning Melissa;
but the old lady had heard nothing of her since her departure with her
aunt, who had never yet returned.&mdash;Alonzo left Vincent’s and went
to Mr. Simpson’s. He told <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘him’">them</ins> all that had happened since he was there, of which,
before, they had heard nothing. At the <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ‘house’">houses</ins> of Mr. Simpson and Vincent he resided some
time, while they made the most dilligent search to discover Melissa; but
nothing could be learned of her fate.</p>

<p>Alonzo then travelled into <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">the</ins> various parts of the country, making such enquiries as
caution dictated of all whom he thought likely to give him
information;&mdash;but he found none who could give him the least
intelligence of his lost Melissa.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<p>In the course of his wanderings he passed near the old mansion house
where Melissa had been confined. He felt an inclination once more to
visit it: he proceeded over the bridge, which was down, but he found the
gate locked. He therefore hurried back and went to John’s, <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘who’">whom</ins> he found at home. On enquiring
of John whether he had yet heard any thing of the young lady and her
aunt; “All I know of the matter, said John, is, that two days after you
<ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘was’">were</ins> here, her aunt
came back with a strange gentleman, and ordered me to go and fetch the
furniture away from the room they had occupied in the old mansion.
I&nbsp;asked her what had become of young madam. She told me that young
madam had behaved very indiscreetly, and she found fault with me for
leaving the keys in her possession, though I did not know that any harm
could arise from it. From the discourse which my wife and I afterwards
overheard between madam and the strange gentleman, I&nbsp;understood
that young madam had been sent to reside with some friend or relation at
a great distance, because her father wanted her to marry a man, and she
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘wished’">wishes</ins> to marry
somebody else.” From John’s plain and simple narrative, Alonzo concluded
that Melissa had been removed by her father’s order, or through the
agency,
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
or instigation of her aunt. Whether his visit to the old mansion had
been somehow discovered or suspected, or whether she was removed by some
preconcerted or antecedent plan, he could not conjecture.&mdash;Still,
the situation in which he found the mansion the night he went to convey
her away, left an inexplicable impression on his mind. He could in no
manner account how the candle could be placed at the window according to
agreement, unless it had been done by herself; and if so, how had she so
suddenly been conveyed away?</p>

<p>Alonzo asked John where Melissa’s aunt now was.</p>

<p>“She left here yesterday morning, he answered, with the strange
gentleman I mentioned, on a visit to some of her friends.”</p>

<p>“Was the strange gentleman you speak of her brother?” asked
Alonzo.</p>

<p>“I believe not, replied John, smiling and winking to his
wife;&mdash;I know not who he was; somebody that madam seems to like
pretty well.”</p>

<p>“Have you the care of the old mansion?” said Alonzo.</p>

<p>“Yes, answered John, I have the keys; I will accompany you thither,
perhaps you would like to purchase it; madam said yesterday she thought
she should sell&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>Alonzo told him he had no <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘thoghts’ 1811 thought">thoughts</ins> of
<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
purchasing, thanked him for his information, and departed.</p>

<p>Convinced now that Melissa was removed by the agency of her
persecutors, he compared the circumstances of John’s relation. “She had
been sent to reside with some friend or relation at a great distance.”
This great distance, he believed to be New London, and her friend or
relation, her cousin, at whose house Alonzo first saw her, under whose
care she would be safe, and Beauman would have an opportunity of
renewing his addresses. Under these impressions, Alonzo did not <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘hesitate long’">long hesitate</ins> what
course to pursue&mdash;he determined to repair to New London
immediately.</p>

<p>In pursuance of his design he went to his father’s. He found the old
gentleman with his man contentedly tilling his farm, and his mother
cheerfully attending to household affairs, as their narrow circumstances
would not admit her to keep a maid without embarrassment. Alonzo’s soul
sickened on comparing the present state of his family with its former
affluence; but it was an unspeakable consolation to see his aged parents
contented and happy in their humble situation; and though the idea could
not pluck the thorn from his <del class = "other"
title = "1804/11 omit">own</del> bosom, yet it tended temporarily to assuage the anguish
of the wound.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<p>“You have been long gone, my son, said his father; I&nbsp;scarcely
knew what had become of you. Since I have become a farmer I know <ins
class = "other" title = "1870 only">but</ins> little of what is going
forward in the world; and indeed we were never happier in our lives.
After stocking and paying for my farm, and purchasing the requisites for
my business, I&nbsp;have got considerable money at <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">my</ins> command: <!-- clearly this author has never
been to a farm; or possibly visited earth at all --> we live frugally,
and realize the blessings of health, comfort, and contentment. Our only
disquietude is on your account, Alonzo. Your affair with Melissa,
I&nbsp;suppose, is not <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘as’">so</ins> favourable as you could wish. But despair not, my son;
hope is the harbinger of fairer prospects: rely on Providence, which
never deserts those who submissively bow to the justice of its
dispensations.”</p>

<p>Unwilling to disturb the serenity of his parents, Alonzo did not tell
them his troubles. He answered, that perhaps all might yet come <ins
class = "other" title = "1870 only">to</ins> right; but that, as in the
present state of his mind he thought a change of situation might be of
advantage, he asked liberty of his father to travel for some little
time. To this his father consented, and offered him a part of the money
he had on hand, which Alonzo refused, saying he did not expect to be
long gone, and his resources had not <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">yet</ins> failed him.</p>

<p>He then sold off his books, his horses,
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
his carriages, &amp;c. the <i>insignia</i> of his better days, but now
useless appendages, from which he raised no inconsiderable sum.&mdash;He
then took a tender and affectionate leave of his parents, and set out
for New London.</p>

<p>Alonzo journeyed along with a heavy heart and in an enfeebled frame
of spirits. Through disappointment, vexation, and the fatigues he had
undergone in wandering about, for a long time, in search of Melissa,
despondency had seized upon his mind, and indisposition upon his body.
He put up the first night within a few miles of New Haven, and as he
passed through <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘the’">that</ins>
town the next morning, the scenes of early life in which he had there
been an actor, moved in melancholy succession over his mind. That day he
grew more indisposed; he experienced an unusual languor, listlessness
and debility; chills, followed by hot flashes, heavy pains in the head
and back, with incessant and intolerable thirst. It was near night when
he reached <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘Killingworth’">Killings&shy;worth</ins>, where he halted, as he felt
unable to go farther: he called for a bed, and through the night was
<ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘wrecked’">racked</ins> with
severe pain, and scorched with a burning fever.</p>

<p>The next morning he requested that the physician of the town might be
sent for;&mdash;he came and ordered a prescription which
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
gave his patient some relief; and by strict attention, in about ten days
Alonzo was able to pursue his journey. He arrived at New London, and
took lodgings with a private family of the name of Wyllis, in a retired
part of the town.</p>

<p>The first object was to ascertain whether Melissa was at her
cousin’s. But how should he obtain this information? He knew no person
in the town except it was those whom he had reason to suppose were
leagued against him. Should he go to the house of her cousin, it might
prove an injury to her if she <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘was’">were</ins> there, and could answer no valuable purpose if she
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘was’">were</ins> not.&mdash;The
evening after he arrived there he wrapped himself up in his cloak and
took the street which led to the house of Melissa’s cousin: he stopped
when he came against it, to see if he could make any discoveries. As
people were passing and repassing the street, he got over into a small
enclosure which adjoined the house, and stood under a tree, about thirty
yards from the house: he had not long occupied this station, before a
lady came to the chamber window, which was flung up, opposite to the
place where he stood; she leaned out, looked earnestly around for a few
minutes, then shut it and retired. She had brought a candle into the
room, but did not bring it
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
to the window; of course he <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘did’">could</ins> not distinguish her features so as to identify
them.</p>

<p>He knew it was not the wife of Melissa’s cousin, and from her
appearance he believed it to be Melissa. Again the window opened, again
the same lady appeared;&mdash;she took a seat at a little distance
within the room; she reclined with her head upon her hand, <del class =
"other" title = "1804/11 omit">and</del> her arm appeared to be
supported by a stand or table. Alonzo’s heart beat violently; he <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">now</del> had a side view of her
face, <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">and</del> was more than
ever convinced that it was Melissa. Her delicate features, though more
pale and dejected than when last he saw her;&mdash;her brown hair, which
fell in artless circles around her lily neck; her arched eye-brows and
commanding aspect. Alonzo moved towards the house, with a design, if
possible, to draw her attention, and should it really prove to be
Melissa, to discover himself. He had proceeded but a few steps before
she arose, shut the window, retired, and the light disappeared. Alonzo
waited a considerable time, but she appeared no more. Supposing she had
retired for the night, he slowly withdrew, chagrined at <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ‘his’">this</ins> disappointment, yet pleased
at the discovery he had made.</p>

<p>The family with whom Alonzo had taken lodgings were fashionable and
respectable.
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
The following afternoon they had appointed to visit a friend, and they
invited Alonzo to accompany them. When they named the family where their
visit was intended, he found it <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘was’">to be</ins> Melissa’s cousin. Alonzo therefore declined going
under pretence of business. He however waited with anxiety for their
return, hoping he should be able to learn by their conversation, whether
Melissa was there or not.&mdash;When they returned he made some
enquiries concerning the families in town, until the conversation turned
upon the family they had visited. “The young lady who resides there,
said Mrs. Wyllis, is undoubtedly in a confirmed decline; she will never
recover.”</p>

<p>Alonzo started, deeply agitated. “Who is the young lady?” he asked.
“She is sister to the gentleman’s wife where we visited, answered Mr.
Wyllis;&mdash;her father lives in Newport, and she has come here for her
health.” “Do you not think, said Mrs. Wyllis, that she resembles <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘her’">their</ins> cousin Melissa, who
resided there some time ago?” “Very much indeed, replied <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘the’">her</ins> husband, only she is not quite
so handsome.”</p>

<p>Again was Alonzo disappointed, and again did he experience a
melancholy pleasure: he had the last night hoped that he had discovered
Melissa; but to find her in a
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
hopeless decline, was worse than that she should remain
undiscovered.</p>

<p>“It is reported, said Mrs. Wyllis, that Melissa has been upon the
verge of matrimony, but that the treaty was somehow broken off; perhaps
Beauman will renew his addresses again, should this be the case.”
“Beauman has other business besides addressing the ladies, answered Mr.
Wyllis. He has marched to the lines near New-York with his new raised
company of volunteers.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagF" id = "tagF" href =
"#noteF">*</a></p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteF" id = "noteF" href = "#tagF">*</a>
New-York was then in possession of the British troops.</p>

<p>From this discourse, Alonzo was convinced that Melissa was not the
person he had seen at her cousin’s the preceding evening, and that she
was not there. He also found that Beauman was not in town. Where to
search next, or what course to pursue, he was at a loss to determine
<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">upon</ins>.</p>

<p>The next morning he rose early and wandered about the town. As he
passed by the house of Melissa’s cousin, he saw the lady, who had
appeared at the window, walking in the garden. Her air, her figure, had
very much the appearance of Melissa; but the lineaments of her
countenance were, when viewed by the light of day, widely dissimilar.
Alonzo felt no <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">strong</del>
curiosity farther to examine her features, but passing on, returned to
his lodgings.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<p>How he was now to proceed, Alonzo could not readily decide. To return
to his native place, appeared to be as useless as to tarry where he was.
For many weeks <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘he had’">had
he</ins> travelled and searched every place where he thought it probable
Melissa might be found, <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">both</del> among her relatives and elsewhere. He <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">had</del> made every effort to obtain some
clue to her removal from the old mansion, but he could learn nothing but
what he had been told by John. If his friends should ever hear of her,
they could not inform him thereof, as no one knew where he was. Would it
not, therefore, be best for him to return back, and consult with his
friends, and if nothing had been heard of her, pursue some other mode of
enquiry? He might, at least, leave directions where his friends might
write to him, in case they should have any thing whereof to apprise
him.</p>

<p>An incident tended to confirm <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘his’">this</ins> resolution. He one night dreamed that he was sitting
in a strange house, contemplating on his present situation, when Melissa
suddenly entered the room. Her appearance was more pale, sickly and
dejected, than when he last saw her. Her elegant form had wasted away,
her eyes were sunk, her cheeks fallen, her lips livid. He fancied it to
be night, she held a candle in her hand,
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
smiling languidly upon him;&mdash;she turned and went out of the room,
beckoning him to follow: he thought he immediately arose and followed
her. She glided through several winding rooms, and at length he lost
sight of her, and the light gradually fading away, he was involved in
deep darkness.&mdash;He groped along, and at length saw a faint distant
glimmer, the course of which he pursued, until he came into a large
room, hung with black tapestry, and illuminated by a number of bright
tapers. On one side of the room appeared a hearse, on which some person
was laid: he went up to it&mdash;the first object that arrested his
attention was the lovely form of Melissa, shrouded in the sable
vestments of death! Cold and lifeless, she lay stretched upon the
hearse, beautiful even in dissolution; the dying smile of complacency
had not yet deserted her cheek. The music of her voice had ceased; her
fine eyes <ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘were’">had</ins>
closed for ever. Insensible to objects in which she once delighted; to
afflictions which had blasted her blooming prospects, and drained the
streams of life, she lay like blossomed trees of spring, overthrown by
rude and boisterous winds. The deep groans which convulsed the
distracted bosom, and <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘shook’">shocked</ins> the trembling frame of Alonzo, broke the delusive
charm: he awoke, rejoiced to find
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
it but a dream, though it impressed his mind with doleful and portentous
forebodings.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he could again close his eyes to sleep; he
at length fell into a slumber, and again he dreamed. He fancied himself
with Melissa, at the house of her father, who had consented to their
union, and that the marriage ceremony between them was there performed.
He thought that Melissa appeared as she had done in her most fortunate
and sprightly days, before the darts of adversity, and the thorns of
affliction, had wounded her heart. Her father seemed to be divested of
all his awful sternness, and gave her to Alonzo with cheerful freedom.
He awoke, and the horrors of his former dream were dissipated by the
happy influences of the last.</p>

<p>“Who knows, he said, but that this may finally be the case; but that
the sun of peace may yet dispel <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">the glooms of</del> these distressful hours!” He arose,
determined to return home in a few days. He went out and enjoyed his
morning walk in a more composed frame of spirits than he had for some
time experienced. He returned, and as he was entering the door he saw
the weekly newspaper of the town, which had been published that morning,
and which the carrier had just flung into the hall.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>The family had not yet arisen. He took up
the
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
paper, <ins class = "other" title = "1870 only">and</ins> carried it to
his chamber, and opened it to read the news of the day. He ran his eye
hastily over it, and was about to lay it aside, when the death list <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘attracted’">arrested</ins> his
attention, by a display of broad black lines. The first article he read
therein was as follows:</p>

<p>“<a name = "maindeath" id = "maindeath">Died, of a consumption</a>,

<p>The paper fell from <ins class = "change"

gone? <!-- Because if the reader has to suffer, so do you, Al. --> Why
am I cursed with memory? O&nbsp;that I might be blessed with
forgetfulness! But why do I talk of blessings?&mdash;Heaven never had
one in store for me. Where are fled my anticipated joys? To the bosom,
the dark bosom of the oblivious tomb! There lie all the graces worthy of
love in life&mdash;all the virtues worthy of lamentation in death! There
lies perfection; perfection has here been found. Was she not all that
even Heaven could demand?&mdash;Fair, lovely, holy and virtuous. Her
tender solicitudes, her enrapturing endearments, her soul-inspiring
blandishments,&mdash;gone, gone for ever? That heavenly form, that
discriminate mind&mdash;all lovely as light, all pure as a
seraph’s&mdash;a prey to worms&mdash;mingled with incorporeal shadows,
regardless of former inquietudes or delights, regardless of the keen
anguish which now wrings tears of blood from my despairing heart!</p>

<p>“Eternal Disposer of events! if virtue be thy special care, why is
the fairest flower in the garden of innocence and purity blasted like a
noxious weed? Why is the bright gem of excellence trampled in the dust
like a worthless pebble?&mdash;Why is Melissa hurried to the tomb?”</p>

<p>Thus raved Alonzo. It was evident that delirium had partially seized
his brain. He arose and flung himself on the bed in
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
unspeakable agony. “And what, Alas! he again exclaimed, now remains for
me? Existence and unparalleled misery. The consolation even of death is
denied me. But Melissa! she&mdash;ah, where is she! Oh, reflection
insupportable! insufferable consideration! Must that heavenly frame
putrify, moulder, and crumble into dust? Must the loathsome spider
nestle on her lily bosom? the odious reptile riot on her delicate limbs?
the worm revel amid the roses of her cheek, fatten on her temples, and
bask in the lustre of her eyes? Alas! the lustre has become dimmed in
death; the rose and the lily are withered; the harmony of her voice has
ceased; the graces, the elegancies of form, the innumerable delicacies
of air, all are gone, and I am left in a state of misery which defies
mitigation or comparison.”</p>

<p>Exhausted by excess of grief, he now lay in <del class = "other"
title = "1804 omits">a</del> stupifying anguish, until the servant
summoned him to breakfast. He told the servant he was indisposed and
requested he might not be disturbed. Mr. Wyllis and his lady came up,
anxious to yield him any assistance in their power, and advised him to
call a physician. He thanked them, but told them it was unnecessary; he
only wanted rest. His extreme distress of mind brought on a relapse of
fever, from which he had but imperfectly recovered. For several
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
days he lay in a very dangerous and doubtful state. A&nbsp;physician was
called, contrary to his choice or knowledge, as for <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">the</ins> most part of the time his mind was
delirious and sensation imperfect. This was, probably the cause of
baffling the disorder. He was in a measure insensible to his woes. He
did not oppose the prescriptions of <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘his’">the</ins> physician. The fever abated; nature triumphed over
disease of <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘body, he’ 1811 ‘body--he’">body, and he</ins> slowly <ins class = "correction" title =
"1851 ‘recov-/ed’ at line break">recovered</ins>, but the malady of his
mind was not removed.</p>

<p>He contemplated on the past. “I fear, said he, I&nbsp;have murmured
against the wisdom of Providence. Forgive, O&nbsp;merciful Creator!
Forgive the frenzies of distraction!” He now recollected that Melissa
once told him that she had an uncle who resided near Charleston in South
Carolina<ins class = "other" title = "1804/11">*</ins>;

thither he supposed she had been sent by her father, when she was
removed from the old mansion, in order to prevent his having access to
her, and with a view to compel her to marry Beauman. Her appearance had
indicated a deep decline when he last saw her. “There, said he, far
removed from friends and acquaintance, there did she languish, there did
she die&mdash;a victim to excessive grief, and cruel parental
persecution.”</p>

<p>As soon as he was able to leave his room,
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
he walked out one evening, and in deep contemplation roved, he knew not
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘whether’ [sic]">where</ins>. The
moon shone brilliantly from her lofty throne; the chill, heavy dews of
autumn glittered on the decaying verdure. The <i>cadeat</i><a class =

Had the whole artillery of Heaven burst, in sheeted flame, from the
skies&mdash;had raging winds mingled the roaring waves with the
mountains&mdash;had an instantaneous earthquake burst beneath his feet,
his frame would not have been so shocked, his soul so
agitated!&mdash;Sudden as the blaze darts from the electric cloud was he
aroused to a lively sense of blessings entombed! The memory of departed
joys passed with rapidity over his imagination; his first meeting with
Melissa; the evening he had attended her to
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
that place; her frequent allusions to the scenery there displayed, when
they had traversed the fields, or reclined in the bower on her favourite
hill; in fine, all the vicissitudes through which they had passed, were
<ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘recalled’">called</ins> to his
mind. His fancy saw her&mdash;<ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">he</ins> felt her gently leaning on his arm, while he tremblingly
pressed her hand.&mdash;Again he saw smiling health crimsoning the
lilies of her cheek; again he saw the bright soul of sympathetic
feelings sparkling in her eye; the air of ease; the graces of attitude;
her brown locks circling the borders of her snowy robe. Again <ins class
= "change" title = "1804 ‘was he’">he was</ins> enraptured by the melody
of her voice.&mdash;Once more would he have been happy, had not fancy
changed the scene. But, alas! she shifted the curtain. He saw Melissa
stretched on the sable hearse, wrapped in the dreary vestments of the
grave; the roses withered; the lilies faded; motionless; the graces
fled; her eyes fixed, and sealed in the glaze of death! Spontaneously he
fell upon his knees, and thus poured forth the overcharged burden of
<ins class = "change" title = "1811 ‘its’">his</ins> anguished
bosom.</p>

<p>“Infinite Ruler of all events! Great Sovereign of this ever changing
world! Omnipotent <ins class = "correction"

"correction" title = "1851 ‘dipenser’">dispenser</ins> of destinies! The

<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
Unsearchable are thy purposes! mysterious thy movements! inscrutable thy

<i>this atom</i> from a dungeon of wretchedness, to worlds of light and
glory, where his only <span class = "smallroman">CONSOLATION</span> is
gone.”<!-- God: “Shut up, Alonzo.” --></p>

<p>Thus prayed the heart-broken Alonzo. It was indeed a worldly prayer;
but perhaps as pure and as acceptable as many of our modern professors
would have made on a similar occasion. He arose and repaired to his <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘lodging’">lodgings</ins>. One
determination only he had now fallen upon&mdash;to bury himself and his
griefs from all with whom he had formerly been acquainted. Why should he
return to the scenes of his former bliss and anxiety, <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">where every countenance would tend to renew
his mourning;</del> where every door would be inscribed with a
<i>memento mori</i>, and where every object would <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘he’">be</ins> shrouded in crape? <!-- must
... resist ... temptation ... to remove “e” --> He therefore turned his
attention to the army; but the army was far distant, and he was too
feeble to prosecute a journey of such an extent.</p>

<p>There were at that time preparations
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
for fitting out a convoy, at private expense, from various parts of the
United States, for the protection of our European trade; they were to
rendezvous at a certain station, and thence proceed with the merchantmen
under their care to the ports of France and Holland, where our trade
principally centered, and return as convoy to some other mercantile
fleet.</p>

<p>One of these ships of war was then nearly fitted out at New-London.
Alonzo offered himself to the captain, who, pleased with his appearance,
gave him the station of commander of marines.</p>

<p>Alonzo prepared himself with all speed for the voyage. He sought, he
wished no acquaintance. His only place of resort, except to his lodgings
and the ship, was to Melissa’s favourite rock: there he bowed as to the
shrine of her spirit, and there he consecrated his devotions.</p>

<p>As he was one day passing through the town, a&nbsp;gentleman stepped
out of an adjoining house and accosted him. Alonzo immediately
recognized him to be the cousin of Melissa, at whose house he had first
seen her. He was dressed in full mourning, which was a sufficient
indication that he was apprised of her death. He invited Alonzo to his
house, and he could not complaisantly refuse the invitation. He
therefore
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
accepted it, and passed an hour with him, from whom he learnt that
Melissa had been sent to her uncle’s at Charleston, for the recovery of
her health, where she died. “Her premature death, said her cousin, has
borne so heavily upon her aged father, that it is feared he will not
long survive.”<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Well may it
wring his bosom, thought Alonzo;<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>his conscience can never be at peace.”
Whether Melissa’s cousin had been informed of the particulars of
Alonzo’s unfortunate attachment, was not known, as he instituted no
conversation on the subject. <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘Oeither’">Neither</ins> did he enquire into Alonzo’s prospects; he only
invited him to call again. Alonzo thanked him, but replied it would be
doubtful, as he should shortly leave town. He made no one acquainted
with his intentions.</p>

<p>The day at length arrived when the ship was to sail, and Alonzo to
leave the shores of America. They spread their <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘canvas’">canvass</ins> to propitious gales; the
breezes <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘rustled’">rushed</ins> from
their woody coverts, and majestically wafted them from the harbour.</p>

<p>Slowly the land receded; fields, forests, hills, mountains, towns and
villages leisurely withdrew, until they were mingled in one common mass.
The ocean opening, expanded and widened, presenting to the astonished
eyes of the untried mariner
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘the willderness [sic] of its’">its
wilderness of</ins> waters. Near sunset, Alonzo ascended the mast to
take a last view of a country once so dear, but whose charms were now
lost forever. The land still appeared like a <ins class = "change" title
= "1804/11/70 ‘semicircular’">simicircular</ins> border of dark green
velvet on the edge of a convex mirror. The sun sunk in fleecy golden
vapours behind it. It now dwindled to discoloured and irregular spots,
which appeared like objects floating, amidst the blue mists of distance,
on the verge of the main, and immediately all was lost beneath the
spherical, watery surface.</p>

<p>Alonzo had fixed his eyes, as near as his judgment could direct,
towards Melissa’s favourite rock, till nothing but sea was discoverable.
With a heart-parting sigh he then descended. They had now launched into
the illimitable world of billows, and the sable wings of night brooded
over the boundless deep.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page151" id = "page151"> </a>

<p>A new scene <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">was</del> now
opened to Alonzo in the wonders of the mighty deep. The sun rising from
and setting in the ocean; the wide-spread region of watery waste, now
<ins class = "correction" title = "1851 ‘snooth’">smooth</ins> as
polished glass, now urged into irregular rolling hillocks, then
swelled&nbsp;to</p>

<p class = "verse">
<ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing or invisible">&nbsp;“</ins>Blue <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘tumbling’">trembling</ins> billows, topp’d with foam,”</p>

<p>or gradually arising into mountainous waves. Often would he traverse
the deck amid the still hours of midnight, when the moon silvered
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
over the liquid surface: “Bright luminary of the lonely hour, he would
say, that now sheddest thy mild and placid ray on the <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘woe-worm’">woe-worn</ins> head of fortune’s
fugitive, dost thou not also pensively shine on the sacred and silent
grave of my Melissa?<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing or invisible">”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Favourable breezes wafted them for many days over the bosom of the
Atlantic.&mdash;At length they were overtaken by a violent storm. The
wind began to blow strongly from the southwest, which soon increased to
a violent gale. The <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘dingy’">dirgy</ins> scud first flew swiftly along the sky; then dark
and heavy clouds filled the atmosphere, mingling with the top-gallant
streamers of the ship. Night hovered over the ocean, rendered horrible
by the intermitting blaze of lightnings, the awful crash of thunder, and
the deafening roar of winds and waves. The sea was rolled into
mountains, capped with foaming fire. Now the ship was soaring among the
thunders of heaven, now sunk in the abyss of waters.</p>

<p>The storm dispersed the fleet, so that when it abated, the ship in
which Alonzo sailed was found alone; they, however, kept on their course
of destination, after repairing their rigging, which had been
considerably disordered by the violence of the gale.</p>

<p>The next morning they discovered a sail which they fondly hoped might
prove to be
<span class = "pagenum">153</span>
one of their own fleet, and accordingly made for it. The ship they were
in pursuit of shortened sail, and towards noon wore round and bore down
upon them, when they discovered that it was not a ship belonging to
their convoy. It appeared to be of <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">about</ins> equal force and dimensions with that of their own;
they therefore, in order to prepare for the worst, got ready with all
speed for action. They slowly approached each other, manoeuvering for
the advantage, till the strange ship ran up British colours, and fired a
gun, which was immediately answered by the other, under the flag of the
United States. It was not long before a close and severe action took
place, which continued for three hours, when both ships were in so
shattered a condition that they were unable to manage a gun.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagI" id = "tagI" href = "#noteI">*</a>
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteI" id = "noteI" href = "#tagI">*</a>
The particulars of this action, in the early stage of the American war,
are yet remembered by many.</span>
The British had lost their captain, and one half their crew, most of the
remainder being wounded.<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>The
Americans had lost their second officer, and their loss in men, both
killed and wounded, was nearly equal to that of the enemy.</p>

<p>While they lay in this condition, unable either to annoy each other
more, or to get away, a&nbsp;large sail appeared, bearing down upon
them, which soon came up and proved to be an English frigate, and which
immediately
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
took the American ship in tow, after removing the crew into the hold of
the frigate. The crew of the British ship were also taken on board of
the frigate, which was no sooner done than the ship went down and was
<del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">for ever</del> buried beneath
mountains of ponderous waves. The frigate then, with the American ship
in tow, made sail, and in a few days reached England. The wounded
prisoners were sent to a hospital, but the others were confined in a
strong prison within the precincts of London.</p>

<p>The American prisoners were huddled into an apartment with British
convicts of various descriptions. Among these Alonzo observed one whose
demeanor arrested his attention. A&nbsp;deep melancholy was impressed
upon his features; his eye was wild and despairing; his figure was
interesting, tall, elegant and handsome. He appeared to be about
twenty-five years of age. He seldom conversed, but when he did, it was
readily discovered that his education had been above the common cast,
and he possessed an enlightened and discriminating mind. Alonzo
sympathetically sought his acquaintance, and discovered therein a unison
of woe.</p>

<p>One evening, when the prisoners were retired to rest, the stranger,
upon Alonzo’s request, rehearsed the following incidents of his
life.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<p>“You express, said he, some surprise at finding a man of my
appearance in so degraded a situation; and you wish to learn the events
which have plunged me in this abject state. These, when I briefly
relate, your wonder will cease.</p>

<p>“My name is Henry Malcomb; my father was a clergyman in the west of
England, and descended from one of the most respectable families in
those parts. I&nbsp;received a classical education, and then entered the
military school, <!-- no such place? --> as I was designed for the army,
to which my earliest inclinations led. As soon as my education was
considered complete, an ensign’s commission <!-- in the army? --> was
procured for me in one of the regiments destined for the West Indies.
Previous to its departure for those islands, I&nbsp;became acquainted
with a Miss Vernon, who was a few years younger than myself, and the
daughter of a gentleman farmer, who had recently purchased and removed
<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">on</ins> to an estate in my
father’s parish. Every thing that was graceful and lovely appeared
centered in her person; every thing that was virtuous and excellent in
her mind. I&nbsp;sought her hand. Our souls soon became united by the
indissoluble bonds of sincerest love, <!-- AFTER he asked for her hand
--><!-- I&nbsp;think that’s in The Rules. --> and as there <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘existed’">were</ins> no parental or other
impediments to our union, it was agreed that as soon as I returned from
the Indies, where
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
it was expected that my stay would be short, the marriage solemnities
should be performed. Solemn oaths of constancy passed between us, and I
sailed, with my regiment, for the Indies.</p>

<p>“While there, I received from her, and returned letters filled with
the tenderest expressions of anxiety and regret of absence. At length
the time came when we were to embark for England, where we arrived after
an absence of about eighteen months. The moment I got on land I hastened
to the house of Mr. Vernon, to see the charmer of my soul. She received
me with all the ardency of affection, and even shed tears of joy in my
presence. I&nbsp;pressed her to name the day which was to perfect our
union and happiness, and the next Sunday, four days only distant, was
agreed upon for me to lead her to the altar. <!-- nuh uh, not without
banns --> How did my heart bound at the prospect of making Miss Vernon
my own!&mdash;of possessing in her all that could render life agreeable;
I&nbsp;hastened home to my family and informed them of my approaching
bliss, who all sympathized in the anticipated joy which swelled my
bosom.<!-- they have a cream to make those go down --></p>

<p>“I had a sister some years older than myself, who had been the friend
and <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘intimate’">inmate</ins> of my
angel in my absence. They were now almost every day together, so that I
had <ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘frequently’">frequent</ins>
opportunities of her company.
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘ one’ (with letter-width space) at page top">One</ins> day she had been with my sister at my father’s,
and I attended her home. On my return, my sister requested me to attend
her in a private room. We therefore retired, and when we were seated she
thus addressed <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 me [no punctuation] 1804/70 me.">me:&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote invisible">“Henry</ins>, you know that to promote your peace, your
welfare, and your happiness, has ever been the pride of my heart.
Nothing except this could extort the secret which I shall now disclose,
and which has yet remained deposited in my own bosom: my duty to a
brother whom I esteem dear as life, forbids me to remain silent. As an
affectionate sister, I&nbsp;cannot tacitly see you thus imposed upon;
I&nbsp;cannot see you the dupe and slave of an artful and insidious
woman, who does not sincerely return your love; nor can I bear to see
your marriage consummated with one whose soul and affections are placed
upon another object.”</p>

<p>“Here she hesitated&mdash;while I, with insufferable anguish of mind,
begged her to proceed.</p>

<p>“About six or eight months after your departure, she continued, it
was reported to Miss Vernon that she had a rival in the Indies; that you
had there found an American beauty, on whom you lavished those
endearments which belonged of right to her alone. This news made, at
first, a&nbsp;deep
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
impression on her mind, but it soon wore away; and whether from this
cause, from fickleness of disposition, or that she never sincerely loved
you, I&nbsp;know not; but this I do know, that a youth has been for some
time past her almost constant companion. To convince you of this, you
need only tomorrow evening, about sunset, conceal yourself near the long
avenue by the side of the rivulet, back of Mr. Vernon’s country-house,
where you will undoubtedly surprise Miss Vernon and her companion in
their usual evening’s walk. If I should be mistaken I will submit to
your censure; but should you find it as I have predicted, you have only
to rush from your concealment, charge her with her perfidy, and renounce
her forever.”</p>

<p>“Of all the plagues, of all the torments, of all the curses which
torture the soul, jealousy of a rival in love is the worst. Enraged,
confounded and astonished, it seemed as if my bosom would have
instantaneously burst. To conceal my emotions, I&nbsp;left my sister’s
apartment, after having thanked her for her information, and <ins class
= "change" title = "1804 ‘promised’">proceeded</ins> to obey her <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘injunction’">injunctions</ins>.
I&nbsp;retired to my own room, and there poured out my execrations.</p>

<p>“Cursed woman! I exclaimed, is it thus you requite my tender love!
Could a vague report of my inconstancy drive you to infidelity! Did not
my continual letters breathe
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
constant adoration? And did not yours portray the same sincerity of
affection? No, it was not <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘this that’">that which</ins> caused you to perjure your plighted vows. It was
that damnable passion for novelty, which more or less holds a <ins class

whole sex. To a new coat, a&nbsp;new face, a&nbsp;new lover, you will
sacrifice honour, principle and virtue. And to those, backed by splendid
power and splendid property, you will forfeit your most sacred
engagements, though made in the presence of heaven<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins>&mdash;Thus did I
rave through a sleepless night.</p>

<p>“The next day I walked into the fields, and before the time my sister
appointed had arrived, I&nbsp;<del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">had</del> worked up my feelings almost to the frenzy of
distraction. I&nbsp;repaired, however, to the spot, and concealed myself
in the place she had named, which was a tuft of laurels by the side of
the walk. I&nbsp;soon perceived Miss Vernon strolling down the avenue,
arm in arm with a young man elegantly dressed, and of singular, delicate
appearance. They were earnestly conversing in a low tone of voice; the
hand of my false fair one was gently pressed in the <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘hands’">hand</ins> of the stranger. As soon as
they had passed the place of my concealment, they turned aside and
seated themselves in a little arbour, <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">at</ins> a few yards distant from where I <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘was’">sat</ins>. The stranger clasped Miss Vernon
<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
in his arms: “Dearest angel! he exclaimed, what an interruption to our
bliss by the return of my hated rival!” With fond caresses and endearing
blandishments, “fear nothing, she replied; I&nbsp;have promised and must
yield him my hand, but you shall never be excluded from my heart; we
shall find sufficient opportunities for private conference.”
I&nbsp;could contain myself no longer&mdash;my brain was on fire. Quick
as lightning I sprang from my covert, and presenting a pistol which I
had concealed under my robe,&mdash;“Die! said I, thou false and perjured
wretch, by the hand thou hast dishonoured, a&nbsp;death too mild for so
foul a crime!” and immediately shot Miss Vernon through the head, who
fell lifeless at my feet! Then suddenly drawing my sword, “And thou,
perfidious contaminator and destroyer of my bliss! cried I&mdash;go!
attend thy companion in iniquity to the black regions of everlasting
torment!” So saying, I&nbsp;plunged <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘the’">my</ins> sword into his bosom. A&nbsp;screech of agony, attended
by the exclamation, ”<i>Henry, your wife! your sister!</i>” awoke me,
too late, to terrors unutterable, to anguish unspeakable, to woes
irretrievable, and insupportable despair! It was indeed my betrothed
wife, it was indeed my affectionate sister, arrayed in man’s habit.<!--
I&nbsp;know that when I read the next page, I’m going to be disappointed
as to what the explanation for this is. --> The one lay dead before me,
the other weltering in her blood! With a feeble
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
and expiring voice, my sister informed me, that in a gay and
inconsiderate moment they had concerted this plan, to try my jealousy,
determining to discover themselves as soon as they had made the
experiment. <!-- Yup, disappointed. Also, this is why the fidelity test
in stories tends to be done with women; they don’t usually have any
weapons. --> “I&nbsp;forgive you, Henry, she said, <ins class = "other"
title = "1804/11/70">I&nbsp;</ins>forgive your mistake, and closed her
eyes for ever in death! What a scene for sensibilities like mine! To
paint or describe it, exceeds the power of language or imagination.
I&nbsp;instantly turned the sword against my own bosom; an unknown hand
arrested it, and prevented its entering my heart. The report of the
pistol, and the dying screech of my sister, had alarmed Mr. Vernon’s
family, who arrived at that moment, one of whom had seized my arm, and
thus hindered me from destroying my own life. I&nbsp;submitted to be
bound and conveyed to prison. My trial came on at the last assizes.
I&nbsp;made no defence; <del class = "other"
title = "1804/11 omit">and</del> was condemned to death. My execution will take place in
eight weeks from to-morrow. I&nbsp;shall cheerfully meet my fate; for
who would endure life when rendered so peculiarly miserable!”</p>

<p>The wretched Malcomb here ended his tale of woe. <!-- and none too
soon --> No tear moistened his eye&mdash;his grief was too despairing
for tears; it preyed upon his heart, drank the vital streams of life,
and burst in convulsive sighs from his burning bosom.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<p>Alonzo seriously contemplated on the incidents and events of <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘the’">this</ins> tragical story.
Conscience whispered him, are not Malcomb’s miseries superior to thine?
Candour and correct reason must have answered yes<ins class =
"correction" title = ". invisible">.&nbsp;</ins>“Melissa perished, said
Alonzo, but not by the hand of her lover: she expired, but not through
the mistaken frenzy of him who adored her. She died, conscious of the
unfeigned love I bore her.”</p>

<p>Alonzo and his fellow prisoners had been robbed, when they were
captured, of every thing except the clothes they wore. Their allowance
of provisions was scanty and poor. They were confined in the third story
of a lofty prison. Time rolled away; no prospects appeared of their
liberation, either by exchange or parole. Some of the prisoners were
removed, as new ones were introduced, to other places of confinement,
until not one American was left except Alonzo.</p>

<p>Meantime the day appointed for the execution of Malcomb drew near.
His past and approaching fate filled the breast of Alonzo with
sympathetic sorrow. He saw his venerable father, his mother, his friends
and acquaintance, with several pious clergymen, frequently enter the
prison to console and comfort him, and to prepare him for the
unchangeable state on which he was soon to enter. He saw his mind
softened
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
by their advice and counsel;&mdash;<ins class = "correction" title =
"1851 ‘frequntly’">frequently</ins> would he burst into
tears;&mdash;often in the solitary hours of night was he heard
addressing the throne of grace for mercy and <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘forgivness’">forgiveness</ins>. But the grief that preyed
at his heart had wasted him to a <del class = "other"
title = "1804/11 omit">mere</del> skeleton; a&nbsp;slow but deleterious fever had
consequently implanted itself in his constitution. Exhausted nature
could make but a weak struggle against disease and affliction like his,
and about a week previous to the day appointed for his execution, he
expired in peace and penitence, trusting in the mercy of his Creator
through the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘merits’">sufferings</ins> of a Redeemer.</p>

<p>Soon after this event, orders came for removing some of the prisoners
to a most loathsome place of confinement in the suburbs of the city. It
fell to Alonzo’s lot to be one. He therefore formed a project for
escaping. He had observed that the gratings in one of the windows of the
apartment were loose and could <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘easily be’">be easily</ins> removed. One night when the prisoners were
asleep, he stripped off his clothes, every article of which he cut into
narrow <ins class = "change" title = "1811 ‘slips’">strips</ins>, tied
them together, fastened one end to one of the strongest gratings,
removed the others until he had made <ins class = "correction" title =
"1851 ‘on’">an</ins> opening large enough to get out, and then, by the
rope he had made of his clothes, let himself down into the yard of the
prison. There he found a
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘piece of long’">long piece of</ins>
timber, which he dragged to the wall, clambered up thereon, and sprang
over into the street. His shoes and hat he had left in the prison, as
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘useless encumbrances’">a useless
encumbrance</ins> without his clothes, all which he had converted into
the means of escape, so that he was now literally stark naked. He stood
a moment to reflect:&mdash;“Here am I, said he, freed from my local
prison indeed, but in the midst of an enemy’s country, without a friend,
without the means of obtaining one day’s subsistence, surrounded by the
darkness of night, destitute of a single article of clothing, and even
unable to form a resolution what step next to take. The ways of heaven
are marvellous&mdash;may I silently bow to its dispensations!” <!-- God,
he’s an idiot. I hope he gets hypothermia. --></p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>

<p>Alonzo passed along the street in this forlorn condition, not knowing
where to proceed, or what course to take. It was about three o’clock in
the morning; the street was illuminated by lamps, and he feared falling
into the hands of the watch. For some time he saw no person; at length a
voice from the other side of the street called out,<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span><ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing">“</ins>Hallo, messmate! what, scudding under bare poles?
You <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">must</del> have
experienced a severe gale indeed thus to have carried away every rag of
sail!”</p>

<p>Alonzo turned, and saw the person who spoke. He was a decent looking
man, of
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
middle age, dressed in a sailor’s habit. Alonzo had often heard of the
generosity and honourable conduct of the British tars: he therefore
approached him and told him his real case, not even concealing his being
taken in actual hostility to the British government, and his escape from
prison. The sailor mused <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">for</ins> a few minutes. “Thy case<ins class = "correction" title
= ", missing">,&nbsp;</ins>said he, is a little critical, but do not
despair. Had I met thee as an enemy, I&nbsp;should have fought thee; but
as it is, compassion is the first consideration. Perhaps I may be in as
bad a situation before the war is ended.” Then slipping off his coat and
giving it to Alonzo, “follow me,” he said, and turning, walked hastily
along the street, followed by Alonzo; he passed into a bye-lane, entered
a small house, and taking Alonzo into a back room, opened a trunk, and
handed out a shirt: “there, said he, pointing to a bed, you can sleep
till morning, when we will see what can be done<ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 single for double quote">.”</ins></p>

<p>The next morning the sailor brought in a very decent suit of clothes
and presented them to Alonzo. “You will make this place your home, said
he, until more favorable prospects appear. In this great city you will
be safe, for even your late gaoler would not recognize you in this
dress. And perhaps some opportunity may offer by which you may return to
your own country<ins class = "correction" title = ". invisible">.”</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
He told Alonzo that his name was Jack Brown; that he was a midshipman on
board the Severn; that he had a wife and four children, and owned the
house in which they then were. “In order to prevent suspicion or
discovery, said he, I&nbsp;shall consider you as a relation from the
country until you are better provided for.” Alonzo was then introduced
to the sailor’s wife, an amiable woman, and here he remained for several
weeks.</p>

<p>One day Alonzo was informed that a number of American prisoners were
brought in. He went to the place where they were landed, and saw several
led away to prison, and some who were sick or disabled, carried to the
hospital. As the hospital was near at hand, Alonzo entered it to see how
the sick and disabled <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">American</ins> prisoners were treated.</p>

<p>He found that they received as much attention as could reasonably be
expected.<a class = "tag" name = "tagK" id = "tagK" href =
"#noteK">*</a>
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteK" id = "noteK" href = "#tagK">*</a>
The Americans who were imprisoned in England, in the time of <ins class
= "change" title = "1804/11">the</ins> war, were treated with much more
humanity than those who were imprisoned <ins class = "other" title =
"1870 only">at Halifax and other places</ins> in America.</span>
As he passed along the different apartments he was surprised at hearing
his name called by a faint voice. He turned to the place from whence it
proceeded, and saw stretched on a mattress, a&nbsp;person who appeared
on the point of expiring. His
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
visage was pale and emaciated, his countenance haggard and ghastly, his
eyes inexpressive and glazy. He held out his withered hand, and feebly
beckoned to Alonzo, who immediately approached him. His features
appeared not unfamiliar to Alonzo, but for a moment he could not
recollect him. “You do not know me,” said the apparently dying stranger.
“Beauman!” exclaimed Alonzo, in surprise. “Yes, replied the sick man, it
is Beauman; you behold me on the verge of eternity; I&nbsp;have but a
short time to continue in this world.” Alonzo enquired how he came in
the power of the enemy. “By the fate of <ins class = "correction" title
= "‘r’ invisible">war</ins>, he replied; I&nbsp;was taken in an action
on York Island, carried on board a prison-ship in New-York, and sent
with a number of others for England. I&nbsp;had received a wound in my
thigh, from a musket ball, during the action; the wound mortified, and
my thigh was amputated on the voyage; since which I have been rapidly
wasting away, and I now feel that the cold hand of death is laid upon
me.” Here he became exhausted, and for <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ‘a’">some</ins> time remained silent. Alonzo had not before
discovered that he had lost his leg: he now <ins class = "change" title
= "1870 ‘discovered’">found</ins> that it had been taken off close to
his body, and that he was worn to <ins class = "correction" title =
"1851 ‘a’ missing or invisible">a&nbsp;</ins>skeleton. When Beauman
revived, he enquired into Alonzo’s affairs.
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
Alonzo related all that had happened to him after leaving New
London.</p>

<p>“You are unhappy, Alonzo, said Beauman, in the death of your Melissa,
to which it is possible I have <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘been,’ with comma">been</ins> <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘undesigningly’">undesignedly</ins> accessory. I&nbsp;could say much on
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘this’">the</ins> subject, would my
strength permit; but it is needless. She is gone, and I must soon go
also. She was sent to her uncle’s at Charleston, by her father, where I
was soon to follow her. It was supposed that thus widely removed from
all access to your company, she would yield to the persuasion of her
friends to renounce you: her unexpected death, however, frustrated every
design of this nature, and overwhelmed her father and family in
inexpressible woe.”</p>

<p>Here Beauman ceased. Alonzo found he wanted rest: he enquired whether
he was in want of any thing to <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘make’">render</ins> him more comfortable. Beauman replied <del class =
"other" title = "1811 omits">that</del> he was not: “For the comforts of
<del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">this</del> life, said he,
I&nbsp;have no relish; medical aid is applied, but without effect.”
Alonzo then left him, promising to call again in the morning.</p>

<p>When Alonzo called the next morning, he perceived an alarming
alteration in Beauman. His extremities were cold, a&nbsp;chilling,
clammy sweat stood upon his face, his respiration was short and
interrupted, his
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
pulse weak and intermitting. He took the hand of Alonzo, and feebly
pressing it,&mdash;“I am dying, said he in a faint voice. If ever you
return to America, inform my friends of my fate.” This Alonzo readily
engaged to do, and told him also that he would not leave him.</p>

<p>Beauman soon fell into a stupor; sensation became suspended; his eyes
rolled up and fixed. Sometimes a partial revival would take place, when
he would fall into incoherent <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘mutterings’">muttering</ins>, calling on the names of his deceased
father, his mother and Melissa; his voice dying away in imperfect
moanings, till his lips continued to move without sound. Towards night
he lay silent, and only continued to breathe with difficulty, till a
slight convulsion gave the freed spirit to the unknown regions of
immaterial existence. Alonzo followed his remains to the grave:
a&nbsp;natural stone was placed at <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘his’">its</ins> head, on which Alonzo, unobserved, carved the initials
of the deceased’s name, with the date of his death, and left him to
moulder with his native dust.</p>

<p>A few days after this event, Jack Brown informed Alonzo that he had
procured the means of his escape. <ins class = "correction" title =
"open quote missing or invisible">“A</ins>&nbsp;person with whom I am
acquainted, said he, and whom I suppose to be a smuggler, has agreed to
carry you to France. There, by application to
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
the American minister, you will be enabled to get to your own country,
if that is your object. About midnight I will pilot you on board, and by
to-morrow’s sun you may be in France.”</p>

<p>At the time appointed, Jack set out bearing a large trunk on his
shoulder, and <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘directing’">directed</ins> Alonzo to follow him. They proceeded down to
a quay, and went on board a small skiff. “Here, said Jack to the
captain, is the gentleman I spoke to you about,” and delivered him the
trunk. Then taking Alonzo aside, “in that trunk, said he, are a few
changes of linen, and here is something to help you till you can help
yourself.” So saying, he slipped ten guineas into his hand. Alonzo
expressed his gratitude with tears. “Say nothing, said Jack, we were
born to help each other in distress, and may Jack never weather a storm
or splice a rope, if he permits a fellow creature to suffer with want
while he has a luncheon on board.” He then shook Alonzo by the hand,
wishing him a good voyage, and went whistling away. The skiff soon
sailed, and the next morning Alonzo was landed in France. Alonzo
proceeded immediately to Paris, not with a view <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘to’">of</ins> returning to America; he had <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">yet</del> no relish for revisiting the land
of his sorrows, the scenes where at every step his
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
heart must bleed afresh, though to bleed it had never ceased. But he was
friendless in a strange land: perhaps, through the aid of the American
minister, Dr. Franklin, to whose fame Alonzo was no stranger, he might
be placed in a situation to procure bread, which was all he at present
hoped or wished.</p>

<p>He therefore presented himself before the doctor, whom he found in
his study.<!-- This is like when a good actor guest-stars on a bad show
and ends up looking uncomfortable and out-of-place. -->&mdash;To be
informed that he was an American and unfortunate, was sufficient to
arouse the feelings of Franklin. He desired Alonzo to be seated, and to
recite his history. This he readily complied with, not concealing his
attachment to Melissa, her father’s barbarity, <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">and</ins> her death in consequence, his own father’s
failure, with all the particulars of his leaving America, his capture,
escape from prison, and arrival in France; as also the town of his
nativity, the name of his father, and the particular circumstances of
his family; concluding by expressing his unconquerable reluctance to
return to his native country, which now would be to him only a gloomy
wilderness, and that his present object was only some means of
support.</p>

<p>The doctor enquired of Alonzo the particular circumstances and time
of his father’s failure. Of this Alonzo gave <del class = "other" title
= "1804 omits">him</del> a minute account. Franklin then sat in deep
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
contemplation for the space of fifteen minutes, without speaking a
word.<!-- Maybe he’s hoping he’ll leave? --> He then took his pen, wrote
a short note, directed it, and gave it to Alonzo: “Deliver this, said
he, to the person to whom it is directed; he will find you employment,
until something more favourable may offer.”</p>

<p>Alonzo took the note, thanked the doctor, and went in search of the
person to whom it was addressed. He soon found the house, which was
situated in one of the most popular streets in Paris. He knocked at the
door, which was opened by an elderly looking man: Alonzo enquired for
the <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘man’">name</ins> to whom the
note was addressed. The gentleman informed him that he was the man.
Alonzo presented him the note, which having read, he desired him to walk
in, and ordered supper. After supper he informed Alonzo that he was an
English bookseller; that he should employ him as a clerk, and desired to
know what wages he demanded. Alonzo replied that he should submit that
to him, being unacquainted with the customary salary of clerks in that
line of business. The gentleman told him that the matter should be
arranged the next day. His name was Grafton.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Grafton took Alonzo into his bookstore, and gave
him his instructions. His business was to sell the
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
books to customers, and a list of <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">the</ins> prices was given him for that purpose. Mr. Grafton
counted out twenty crowns and gave them to Alonzo: “You may want some
necessaries, said he; and as you have set no price on your services, we
shall not differ about the wages if you are attentive and faithful.”</p>

<p>Alonzo gave his employer no <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘reason’">room</ins> to complain; nor had he any reason to be
discontented with his situation. Mr. Grafton regularly advanced him
twenty crowns at the commencement of every month, and boarded him in his
family. Alonzo dressed <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">himself</del> in deep mourning. He sought no company; he found
consolation only in solitude, if consolation it could be called.</p>

<p>As he was walking out early one morning, he discovered something
lying in the street, which he at first supposed to be a small piece of
silk: he took it up and found it to be a <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ‘curious’">curiously</ins> wrought purse, containing a few guineas
with some small pieces of silver, and something at the bottom carefully
wrapped in a piece of paper; he unfolded it, and was thunderstruck at
beholding an elegant miniature of Melissa! Her sweetly pensive features,
her expressive countenance, her soul-enlivening eye! The shock was
almost too powerful for his senses. Wildered in a maze of wonders, he
knew not what to conjecture. Melissa’s
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
miniature found in the streets of Paris, after she had some time been
dead! He viewed it, he clasped it to his bosom.&mdash;“Such, said he,
did she appear, ere the corroding cankers of grief had blighted her
heavenly charms! By what providential miracle am I possessed of the
likeness, when the original is no more? What benevolent angel has taken
pity on my sufferings, and conveyed <del class = "other" title =
"1804/11 omit">to</del> me this inestimable prize?”</p>

<p>But though he had thus become possessed of what he esteemed most <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ‘invaluable’">valuable</ins>, what right
had he to withhold it from the lawful owner, could the owner indeed be
found? Perhaps the person who had lost it would part with it; perhaps
the money contained in the purse was of more value to that person than
the miniature. At any rate, justice required that he should endeavour to
find to whom it belonged: this he might do by advertising, which he
immediately concluded upon, resolving, should the owner appear, to
purchase the miniature, if possibly within his power.</p>

<p>Passing into another street, he saw several hand-bills stuck up on
the walls of houses; stepping up to one, he read as follows:</p>

<p>“Lost, between the hours of <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘9 and 10’">nine and ten</ins> last evening, in the <i>Rue de <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘Loire’">Loir</ins></i>, a&nbsp;small silk purse,
containing a few pieces of money, and a lady’s miniature. One hundred
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
crowns will be given to the person who may have found it, and will
restore it to the owner at the <i>American Hotel</i>, near the
<i>Louvre</i>, Room No.&nbsp;4.”</p>

<p>It was printed both in the French and English languages. By the
reward here offered, Alonzo was convinced that the miniature belonged to
some person who set a value upon it. Determined to explicate the
mystery, he proceeded immediately to the place, found the room mentioned
in the bill, and knocked at the door. A&nbsp;servant appeared, of whom
Alonzo enquired for the lodger. The servant answered him in French,
which Alonzo did not understand: <!-- I&nbsp;guess they only get
English-speaking customers at the bookstore. In France. --> he replied
in his own language, but found it was unintelligible to the servant.
A&nbsp;grave middle aged gentleman then came to the door from within the
room and ended their jabbering at each other: he, in the English
language, desired Alonzo to walk in. It was an apartment, neatly
furnished; no person was <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘therin’">therein</ins> except the gentleman and servant before
mentioned, and a person who sat writing in a corner of the room, with
his back towards them.</p>

<p>Alonzo informed the gentleman that he had called according to the
direction in a bill of advertisement to enquire for the person who the
preceding night, had lost a purse and miniature. The person who was
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
writing had hitherto taken no notice of what <del class = "other" title
= "1870 omits">had</del> passed; but at the sound of Alonzo’s voice,
after he had entered the room, he started and turned about, and at <ins
class = "other" title = "1870 only">the</ins> mention of the miniature,
he rose up. Alonzo fixed his eyes upon him: they both stood for a few
moments silent: for a short time their recollection was confused and
imperfect, but the mists of doubt were soon dissipated.
“Edgar!”&mdash;“Alonzo!” they alternately exclaimed. It was indeed
Edgar, the early friend and fellow student of Alonzo&mdash;the brother
of Melissa! In an instant they were in each <ins class = "change" title
= "1870 ‘other’s’">others</ins> arms.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>

<p>Edgar and Alonzo retired to a separate room. Edgar informed Alonzo
that the news of Melissa’s death reached him, by a letter from his
father, while <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘he was at’ 1811 ‘at’">with</ins> the army; that he immediately procured a furlough, and
visited his father, whom, with his mother, he found <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">in</del> inconsolable distress.&mdash;“The letter
which my uncle had written, said Edgar, announcing her death, mentioned
with what patience and placidity she endured her malady, and with what
calmness and resignation she met the approach of death. Her last
moments, like her whole life, were unruffled and serene. She is in
heaven Alonzo&mdash;she is an angel!”&mdash;Swelling grief here choaked
the utterance of Edgar; for some
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
time he could proceed no farther, and Alonzo, with bursting bosom,
mingled his tears.</p>

<p>“My father, resumed Edgar, bent on uniting her to Beauman or at least
of preventing her union with you, had removed her to a desolate family
mansion, and placed her under the care of an aunt. At that place, he
either suspected, <ins class = "correction" title = "1851 ‘on’">or</ins>
really discovered that you had recourse to her while my aunt was absent
on business. She was therefore no longer entrusted to the care of her
aunt, but my father immediately formed and executed the plan of sending
her to his brother in South Carolina, under pretence of restoring her to
health by change of climate, as her health in reality had began rapidly
to decay. There it was designed that Beauman should shortly follow her,
with recommendations from my father to her uncle, urging him to use all
possible means which might tend to persuade her to become the wife of
Beauman. But change of climate only encreased <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘her’">the</ins> load of sorrows, and she soon sunk
beneath them. The letter mentioned nothing of her troubles: possibly my
uncle’s family knew nothing of them: to them, probably,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“She never told her
love,</p>
<p>But sat like Patience on a monument</p>
<p>Smiling at grief; while sad concealment,</p>
<p>Like a worm in the bud,</p>
<p>Fed on her damask cheek.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<p>“My father’s distress was excessive: often did he accuse himself of
barbarity, and he once earnestly expressed a wish that he had consented
to her union with you. My father, I&nbsp;know, is parsimonious, but he
sincerely loved his children. Inflexible as is his nature, the untimely
death of a truly affectionate and only daughter will, I&nbsp;much fear,
precipitate him, and perhaps my mother also, to a speedy grave.</p>

<p>“As soon as my feelings would permit, I repaired to your father’s,
and made enquiry concerning you. I&nbsp;found your parents content in
their humble state, except that your father had been ill, but was
recovering. Of you they had heard nothing since your departure, and they
deeply lamented your absence. And from Vincent I could obtain no farther
information.</p>

<p>“Sick of the world, I returned to the army. An American consul was
soon to sail for Holland:&mdash;I solicited and obtained the appointment
of secretary. I&nbsp;hoped by visiting distant countries, in some
measure to relieve my mind from the deep melancholy with which it was
oppressed. We were to proceed first to Paris, where we have been a few
days; to-morrow we are to depart for Holland. The consul is the man who
introduced you into the room where you found&nbsp;me.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<p>“Last evening I lost the miniature which I suppose you <ins class =
"other" title = "1870 only">to</ins> have found: the chain to which it
was suspended around my neck, had broken while I was walking the street.
I&nbsp;carefully wrapped it in paper and deposited it in my purse, which
I probably dropped on replacing <del class = "other"
title = "1804 omits">it</del> in my pocket, and did not discover the loss until this
morning. I&nbsp;immediately made diligent search, but not finding it,
I&nbsp;put up bills of advertisement. The likeness was taken in my
sister’s happiest days. After I had entered upon my professional studies
in New-York, I&nbsp;became acquainted with a miniature painter, who took
my likeness. He afterwards went into the country, and as I found he was
to pass near my father’s, I&nbsp;engaged him to call there and take my
sister’s likeness also. We exchanged them soon after. It was dear to me,
even while the original remained; but since she is gone it has become a
most precious and <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘invaluable’">valuable</ins> relique.”</p>

<p>All the tender powers of <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘Alonzon’s’">Alonzo’s</ins> soul were called into action by Edgar’s
recital. The “days of other years”&mdash;the ghosts of <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11/70 ‘sepulchred’">sepulchered</ins> blessings,
passed in painful review. Added to these, the penurious condition of his
parents, his father’s recent illness, and his probable inability to
procure the bread of his family, all tended more deeply to sink his
spirits in the gulf of melancholy
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
and misery. He however informed Edgar of all that had <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘hapened’">happened</ins> since they parted
at Vincent’s&mdash;respecting the old mansion Melissa’s extraordinary
disappearance therefrom, the manner in which he was informed of her
death, his departure from America, capture, escape, Beauman’s death,
arrival in France, and his finding the miniature. To Edgar as well as
Alonzo, <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘Melissa’">Melissa’s</ins> sudden and unaccountable removal from the
mansion was mysterious and inexplicable.</p>

<p>As Edgar was to depart early the next morning, they neither slept nor
separated that night.</p>

<p>“If it were not for your reluctance to revisit your native country,
said Edgar, I&nbsp;should urge you to accompany me to Holland, and
thence return with me to America. Necessity and duty require that I
should not be long absent, as my parents want my assistance, and they
are now childless.”</p>

<p>“Suffer me, answered Alonzo, to bury myself in this city for the
present: should I ever again awake to real life, I&nbsp;will seek you
out if you are on the earth;&mdash;but now, I&nbsp;can only be a
companion to my miseries.”</p>

<p>The next morning as they were about to <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/11 ‘part’">depart</ins>, Alonzo took Melissa’s miniature from his
bosom, <ins class = "other" title = "1804/11">he</ins> contemplated the
picture a few moments with ardent emotion, and
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
presented it to Edgar. “Keep it, said Edgar, it is thine. I&nbsp;bestow
it upon thee as I would the original, had not death become the rival of
thy love, and my affection.&mdash;Suffer not the sacred symbol too
tenderly to renew your sorrows. How swiftly, Alonzo, does this restless
life fleet away!&mdash;How soon shall we pass the barriers of
terrestrial existence! Let us live worthy of ourselves, of our holy
religion, of Melissa&mdash;Melissa, whom, when a few more suns have
arisen and set, we shall meet in regions where all tears shall be
eternally wiped from every eye.”<!-- that doesn’t sound like a very
happy place. --></p>

<p>With what unspeakable sensibilities was it returned to Alonzo’s
bosom! Edgar offered Alonzo pecuniary assistance, which the latter
refused: “I&nbsp;am in business, said he, which brings me a decent
support, and that is sufficient.” They agreed to write each other as
frequently as possible, and then affectionately parted: Edgar sailed for
Holland, and Alonzo returned to his business at Mr. Grafton’s.</p>

<p>Some time after this Alonzo received a message from Dr. Franklin,
requiring his attendance at his house, which summons he immediately
obeyed. The doctor introduced him into his study, and after being
seated, he earnestly viewed Alonzo for some time, and thus addressed
him:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<p>“Young man, your views, your resolutions, and your present conduct,
are totally wrong. Disappointment, you say, has driven you from your
native country. Disappointment in what? In obtaining the object on which
you most doated. And suppose this object had been obtained, would your
happiness have been complete? Your own reason, if you coolly consult it,
will convince you of the contrary. Do you not remember when an infant,
how you cried, and teazed your nurse, or your parents, for a rattle, or
some gay trinket?&mdash;Your whole soul was fixed upon the enchanting
bauble; but when obtained, you soon cast it away, and sighed as <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ‘ardently’">earnestly</ins> for some
other trifle, some new toy. Thus it is through life; the fancied value
of an object ceases with the attainment; it becomes familiar, and its
charm is lost.<!-- Oh snap, Benjamin Franklin smackdown! --></p>

<p>“Was it the splendours of beauty which enraptured you? Sickness may,
and age must destroy the symmetry of the most finished form&mdash;the
brilliancy of the finest features. Was it the graces of the mind?
I&nbsp;tell you, that by familiarity, these allurements are lost, and
the mind, left vacant, turns to some other source to supply <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">the</ins> <i>vacuum</i>. <!-- doesn’t make
sense to me --> <!-- what, the whole book? --></p>

<p>“Stripped of all <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">but</ins>
their intrinsic value, how poor, how vain, and how worthless, are those
things we name pleasures, and enjoyments.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<p>“Besides, the attainment of your wishes might have been the death of
your hopes. If my reasoning is correct, the ardency of your passion
might have closed with the pursuit. An every day suit, however rich and
costly the texture, is soon worn threadbare. On your part, indifference
would consequently succeed: on the part of your partner, disappointment,
jealousy, and disgust. What might follow is needless for me to
name;&mdash;your soul must shudder at the idea of conjugal
infidelity!</p>

<p>“But admitting the most favourable consequences; turn the brightest
side of the picture; admitting as much happiness as the connubial state
will allow: how might your bosom have been wounded by the sickness and
death of your children, or their disorderly and disobedient conduct! You
must know also, that the warmth of youthful passion must soon cease, and
it is merely a hazardous chance whether friendship will supply the
absence of affection.</p>

<p>“After all, my young friend, it will be well for you to consider,
whether the all-wise dispensing hand of Providence, has not directed
this matter which you esteem so great an affliction, for your greatest
good, and most essential advantage. And suffer me to tell you, that in
all my observations on life, I&nbsp;have always found that those
connections
<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
which were formed from inordinate passion, or what <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘you’">some</ins> would call pure affection, have been
ever the most unhappy. Examine the varied circles of society, you will
there see this axiom demonstrated; you will there see how few among the
sentimentally refined are even apparently at ease; while those,
insusceptible of what you name tender attachments, or who receive them
only as things of course, plod on through life, without even
experiencing the least inconvenience from a want of the pleasures they
are <i>supposed</i> to bestow, or the pains they are sure to create.
Beware, then, my son, beware of yielding the heart to the effeminacies
of passion. Exquisite sensibilities are ever subject to exquisite
inquietudes. Counsel with correct reason, place entire dependence on the
<span class = "smallcaps">Supreme</span>, and the triumph of fortitude
and resignation will be yours.”</p>

<p>Franklin paused. His reasonings, however they convinced the
understanding, could not heal the wounds of Alonzo’s bosom.&mdash;In
Melissa he looked for as much happiness as earth could afford, nor could
he see any prospect in life which could repair the loss he had
sustained.</p>

<p>“You have, resumed the philosopher, deserted an indulgent father,
a&nbsp;fond and tender mother, who must want your aid; now,
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
perhaps, unable to toil for bread; now, possibly laid upon the bed of
sickness, calling, in anguish or delirium, for the filial hand of their
only son to administer relief.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>All the parental feelings of Alonzo were now
called into poignant action.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“You have left a country, bleeding at every
pore, desolated by the ravages of war, wrecked by the thunders of
battle, her heroes slain, her children captured. This country
asks&mdash;she demands&mdash;you owe her your services: God and nature
call upon you to defend her, while here you bury yourself in inglorious
inactivity, pining for a <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘hopeless’">hapless</ins> object, which, by all your lamentations, you
can never bring back to the regions of mortality.”</p>

<p>This aroused the patriotic flame in the bosom of Alonzo; and he
voluntarily exclaimed, “I&nbsp;will go to the relief of my
parents&mdash;I will fly to the defence of my country!”</p>

<p>“In former days, continued Franklin, I was well acquainted with your
father. As soon as you informed me of his failure, I&nbsp;wrote to my
correspondent in England, and found, as I expected, that he had been
overreached by swindlers and sharpers.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>The pretended failure of the merchants with
whom he was in company, was all a sham, <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ‘as was’">as,</ins> also the reported loss of the ships in their
employ. The merchants fled to England:
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
I have had them arrested, and they have given up their effects to much
more than the amount of their debts. I&nbsp;have therefore procured a
reversion of your father’s losses, which, with costs, damages, and
interests, when legally stated, he will receive of my agent in
Philadelphia, to whom I shall transmit sufficient documents by you, and
I shall advance you a sum equal to the expenses of your voyage, which
will be liquidated by the said agent. <!-- Oh Franklin, you turned out
to be a deus ex machina. I’m so disappointed. --> A ship sails in a few
days from Havre, for Savannah in Georgia: <!-- Wasn’t Georgia heavily
controlled by the British during the war? Guy’s gonna get captured again
as soon as he lands. --> it would, indeed, be more convenient were she
bound to some more northern port, but I know of no other which will sail
for any part of America <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘in’">for</ins> some time. In her therefore I would advise you to take
passage: it is not very material on what part of the continent you are
landed; you will soon reach Philadelphia, transact your business,
restore your father to his property, and be ready to serve your
country.” <!-- I think Franklin’s hoping Alonzo will get killed in
battle and his father will leave all his money to Franklin. Not a bad
plan. --></p>

<p>If any thing could have given Alonzo consolation, it must have been
this noble, generous and disinterested conduct of the great Franklin in
favour of his father, by which his family were restored to ease and to
independence. Ah! had this but <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">have</del> happened in time to save a life far dearer than his
own! The reflection was too painful. The idea, however, of giving joy to
his aged
<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
parents, hastened his departure. Furnished with proper documents and
credentials from Franklin, his benefactor, he took leave of him, with
the warmest expressions of gratitude, as also of Mr. Grafton, and sailed
for Savannah, where he arrived in about eight weeks.</p>

<p>Intent on his purpose, he immediately purchased a carriage and
proceeded on for Philadelphia. As he approached Charleston, his bosom
swelled with mournful recollections. He arrived in that city in the
afternoon, and at evening he walked out, and entered a little ale house,
which stood near the large burial ground. An elderly woman and two small
children were the only persons in the house, except himself. After
calling for a pint of ale, he enquired of the old lady, if Col<ins class
= "correction" title = ". invisible">.&nbsp;</ins>D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, (Melissa’s uncle) did not live near the
city. She informed him that he resided about a mile from <del class =
"other" title = "1804 omits">the</del> town, where he had an elegant
seat, and that he was very rich.</p>

<p>“Was there not a young lady, asked Alonzo, who died there about
eighteen months ago?”</p>

<p>“La me! said she, did you know her? Yes: and a sweeter or more
handsome lady the sun never shined on. And then she was so good, so
patient in her sickness.&mdash;Poor, dear distressed girl, she pined
away
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
to skin and <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘bone’">bones</ins>
before she died. She was not Col. D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s daughter, only somehow related: she came
here in hopes that a change of air might do her good. She came
from&mdash;la me! I&nbsp;cannot think of the name of the place;&mdash;it
is a crabbed name though.”</p>

<p>“Connecticut, was it not?” said Alonzo.</p>

<p>“O yes, that was it, replied she. Dear me! then you knew her, did
you, sir?&mdash;Well, we have not her like left in Charleston; that we
han’t;&mdash;and then there was such ado at her funeral; five hundred
people, I&nbsp;dare say, with eight young ladies for pall-bearers, all
dressed in white, with black ribbons, and all the bells tolling.”</p>

<p>“Where was she buried?” enquired Alonzo.</p>

<p>“In the church-yard right before our door, she answered. My husband
is the sexton; he put up her large white marble tomb-stones;<span class
= "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>they are the largest and whitest in the
whole burying-ground; and so, indeed, they ought to be, for never was
there a person who deserved them more.”</p>

<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteL" id = "noteL" href = "#tagL">*</a>
This bird, though not an inhabitant of the northern states, is
frequently to be met with in Georgia and the Carolinas.</span>

<p>Tired with the old woman’s garrulity, and with a bosom bursting with
anguish, Alonzo paid for his ale without drinking it, bade her good
night, and slowly proceeded to the church-yard. The moon, in full
lustre, shone with solemn, silvery ray, on the
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘consecrated’">sacred</ins> piles,
and <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘funereal’">funeral</ins>
monuments of the sacred dead; the wind murmured mournfully among the
weeping willows; a&nbsp;solitary nightingale<a class = "tag" name =
"tagL" id = "tagL" href = "#noteL">*</a> sang plaintively in the distant
forest; and a whippoorwill, Melissa’s favourite bird, whistled near the
portico of the church. The large white tomb-stones soon caught the eye
of Alonzo. He approached them with tremulous step, and with feelings too
agitated for description. On the head-stone he read as follows:</p>

<div class = "center">
<p>SACRED</p>
<p>To the Memory of inestimable departed</p>
<p><span class = "smallcaps">Worth</span>;</p>

<p>Whose remains are deposited here, and</p>
<p>whose ethereal part became a seraph,</p>
<p><ins class = "change" title = "1811 ‘Oct.’">October</ins> 26, 1776,
<!-- this cannot be right --></p>
<p>In the 18th year of her age.</p>
</div>

<p>Alonzo bent, <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">he</ins>
kneeled, he prostrated himself, he clasped the green turf which enclosed
her grave, he watered it with his tears, he warmed it with his sighs.
“Where art thou, bright beam of heavenly light! he said. Come to my
troubled soul, blessed spirit! Come, holy shade! come in all thy native
loveliness, and cheer the bosom
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
of wretchedness, by thy grief dispersing smile! On the ray of yon
evening star descend. One moment leave the celestial regions of
glory&mdash;leave, one moment, thy sister beatitudes, and glide, in
entrancing beauty, before me: wave, benignly wave thy white hand, and
assuage the anguish of despairing sorrow! Alas! in vain my invocation!
A&nbsp;curtain, impenetrable, is drawn betwixt me and thee, only to be
disclosed by the dissolution of nature.”</p>

<p>He arose and walked away: suddenly he stopped. “Yet, said he, if
spirits departed lose not the power of recollection;&mdash;if they have
knowledge of present events on earth, Melissa cannot have forgotten
me&mdash;she must pity me.” He returned to the grave; he took her
miniature from his bosom; he held it up, and earnestly viewed it by the
moon’s pale ray.</p>

<p>“Ah, Franklin! he exclaimed, how tenderly <ins class = "other" title
= "1804 only">pensive</ins> does she beam her lovely eye upon me! How
often have I drank delicious extacy from the delicacy of those
unrivalled charms! How often have they taught me to anticipate
superlative and uninterrupted bliss! Mistaken and delusive hope!

over her grave, while the mourning breezes sigh sadly amid your

ray reluctantly withdraw!&mdash;And when the final trump shall renovate
and arouse the sleeping saint;&mdash;when on “buoyant step” she soars to
glory, may our meeting spirits join in beatifick transport! May my

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page190" id = "page190"> </a>

<p>Alonzo having thus poured out the effusions of an overcharged heart,
pensively returned to the inn, which he entered and seated himself in
the common room, in deep contemplation. As usual at public inns,
a&nbsp;number of people were in the room, among whom were several
officers of the American army. Alonzo was too deeply absorbed in
melancholy reflection, to notice passing incidents, until a young
officer came, seated himself by him, and entered into <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">a</ins> conversation respecting the events
of the war. He appeared to be about Alonzo’s age; his person was
interesting, his manners sprightly, his observations
correct.&mdash;Alonzo was, in some degree, aroused from his
abstractedness;&mdash;the manners of the
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
stranger pleased him. His frankness, his ease, his understanding, his
urbanity, void of vanity or sophistication, sympathetically caught the
feelings of Alonzo, and he even felt a sort of solemn regret when the
stranger departed. He soon retired to bed, determining to proceed <ins
class = "other" title = "1804 only">on</ins> early <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘the next’">in the</ins> morning.</p>

<p>He arose about daylight; the horizon was overcast, and it had begun
to rain, which before sunrise <del class = "other"
title = "1804/11 omit">had</del> encreased to a violent storm. He found therefore that he
must content himself to stay until it was over, which did not happen
till near night, and too late to pursue his journey. He was informed by
the inn-keeper, that the theatre, which had been closed since the
commencement of the war, was to be opened <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">for</ins> that night only, with the tragedy of
<i>Gustavus</i>, and close with a representation of Burgoyne’s capture,
and some other recent events of the American war. To “wing the hours
with swifter speed,” Alonzo determined to go to the theatre, and at the
hour appointed he repaired thither.</p>

<p>As he was proceeding to take his seat, he passed <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘a’">the</ins> box where sat the young officer,
whose manners had so prepossessed him the preceding evening at the inn.
He immediately arose: they exchanged salutations, and Alonzo walked on
and took his seat. The evening was warm, and the
<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
house exceedingly crowded. After the tragedy was through, and before the
after-piece commenced, the young officer came to Alonzo’s box, and made
some remarks on the merit of the actors. While they were discoursing,
a&nbsp;bustle took place in one part of the house, and several people
gathered around a box, at a little distance from them. The officer
turned, left Alonzo, and hastened to the place. To the general enquiry
<ins class = "other" title = "1804/11">of</ins>, “<i>what’s the
matter?</i>” it was answered, that “a&nbsp;lady had fainted.” She was
led out, and the tumult subsided.</p>

<p>As soon as the after-piece was closed, Alonzo returned to the inn. As
he passed along he cast his eyes toward the church-yard, where <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘laid’">lay</ins> the “wither’d blessings
of his richest joys.” Affection, passion, inclination, urged him to go
and breathe a farewell sigh, to drop a final tear over the grave of
Melissa. Discretion, reason, wisdom forbade it&mdash;forbade that he
<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">should</ins> re-pierce the ten
thousand wounds of his bosom, by the acute revival of unavailing
sorrows. He hurried to his chamber.</p>

<p>As he prepared to retire to rest, he saw a book lying on the table
near his bed. On taking it up he found it to be <i>Young’s Night
Thoughts</i>, a&nbsp;book which, in happier days, had been the solace of
many a gloomy, many a lucid hour. He took it up and the
<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
first lines he cast his eyes upon were the following:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Song, beauty, <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">youth,</del>
love, virtue, joy: this group</p>
<p>Of bright ideas&mdash;flowers of Paradise,</p>
<p>As yet <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘a forfeit’">unforfeit</ins>! in one blaze we bind.</p>
<p>Kneel, and present it to the skies; as all</p>
<p>We guess of Heaven! And <i>these</i> were all her own</p>
<p>And she was mine, and I was&mdash;was most blest&mdash;</p>
<p>Like blossom’d trees o’erturn’d by vernal storm,</p>
<p>Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay&mdash;</p>
<p>Ye that e’er lost an angel, pity me.”</p>
</div>

<p>His tears fell fast upon the book! He replaced it and flung himself
into bed. Sleep was far from him; he closed not his eyes till the
portals of light were unbarred in the east, when he fell into
interrupted slumbers.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the morning was considerably advanced. He arose. One
consolation was yet left&mdash;to see his parents happy. He went down to
order his carriage; his favourite stranger, the young officer, was in
waiting, and requested a private interview. They immediately retired to
a separate room, <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘where’">when</ins>
the stranger thus addressed Alonzo:</p>

<p>“From our short acquaintance, you may, sir, consider it singular that
I should attempt to scrutinize your private concerns, <del class =
"other" title = "1804/11 omit">and</del> more extraordinary <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ‘may you’">you may</ins> esteem it, when I
inform you of my reasons for so doing. Judging, however, from
appearances, I&nbsp;have no doubt of your candour. If my
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
questions should be deemed improper, you will tell me&nbsp;so.”</p>

<p>Alonzo assured him <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">that</ins> he would treat him candidly. “This I believe, said the
young officer; I&nbsp;take the liberty therefore to ask if you are an
American?”<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“I am,” answered
Alonzo. “I&nbsp;presume, said the stranger&mdash;the question is a
delicate one&mdash;I presume your family is respectable?” “Sacredly so,”
replied Alonzo. “Are you <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘unmarried’">married</ins>, sir?” “I&nbsp;am <ins class = "change" title
= "1804/11 ‘now’">not</ins>, and have ever been single.” “Have you any
prospects of connecting in marriage?” “I&nbsp;have not, sir.”
“I&nbsp;may then safely proceed, said the stranger; I&nbsp;trust you
will hear me attentively; you will judge maturely; you will decide
correctly, <del class = "other" title = "1804/11 omit">and</del> I am
confident that you will answer me sincerely.</p>

<p>“A young lady of this city, with whom I am well acquainted, and to
whom, indeed, I&nbsp;am distantly related, whose father is affluent,
whose connections are eminently respectable, whose manners are engaging,
whose mind is virtue, whose elegance of form and personal beauty defy
competition, is the cause, sir, of this mission.&mdash;Early introduced
into the higher walks of life, she has passed the rounds of fashionable
company; numberless suitors <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">have</ins> sighed for her hand, whom she complaisantly dismissed
without disobliging, as her heart had not yet been

touched by the tender passion of love. Surprising as it may, however,
seem, it is now about six months since she saw in her dream the youth
who possessed the power to inspire her with this passion. In her dream
she saw a young gentleman whose interesting manners and appearance,
impressed her so deeply that she found she must be unhappy without him.
She thought it was in a mixed company she saw him, but that she could
not get an opportunity to speak to him. It seemed that if she could but
speak <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘with’">to</ins> him, all
difficulties would at once be removed. At length he approached her, and
just as he was about to address her, she awoke.</p>

<p>“This extraordinary dream she <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘has’">had</ins> communicated to several of her
acquaintance.&mdash;Confident that she should some time or other behold
the real person whose semblance she had seen in her dream, she has never
since been perfectly at ease in her mind. Her father, who has but two
children<ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘ besides herself’ 1811 ‘, one besides herself’">, one beside herself</ins>, being <ins class =
"change" title = "1811 ‘doting’">dotingly</ins> fond of her, has
promised that if ever she meets this unknown stranger, he will not
oppose their union, provided he is respectable, and that, if worthy of
her hand, he will make him independent.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“On</ins> my
return from the inn the evening I first saw you, I&nbsp;told my
sister&mdash;I beg pardon, sir&mdash;I was wandering from my
subject&mdash;after
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
I first met you at the inn, I&nbsp;fell in company with the lady, and in
a <ins class = "change" title = "1811 ‘railing’">rallying</ins> way told
her <del class = "other" title = "1804/11 omit">that</del> I had seen
her <i>invisible beau</i>, as we used to call the gentleman of the
dream. I&nbsp;superficially described your person, and descanted a
little on the embellishments of your mind. She listened with some
curiosity and attention; but I had so often jested with her in this
manner, that she thought <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">but</ins> little of it. At the play last night, I&nbsp;had just
been speaking to her when I came to your box: her eyes followed me, but
no sooner had they rested on you, than she fainted! This was the cause
of my leaving you so abruptly, and <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">of my</ins> not returning. We conveyed her home, when she informed
me that you was the person she had seen in her dream!</p>

<p>“To me only, she preferred disclosing the circumstance at present,
for reasons which must be obvious to your understanding.&mdash;Even her
father and mother are not informed of it, and should my mission prove
unsuccessful, none except you, sir, she and myself, I&nbsp;hope and
trust, will ever know any thing of the matter.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, it is necessary <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">for me</del> farther to explain. As singular as the circumstances
which I have related may appear to you, to me they must appear as
strange.&mdash;One valuable purpose is, however, answered
<span class = "pagenum">198</span>
thereby; it will exclude the imputation of capriciousness<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>the freakish whim of <i>love at first
sight</i>, which exists only in novels and romances. You, sir, are
young, unmarried, unaffianced, your affections free: such is the
condition of the lady. She enquires not into the state of your property!
she asks not riches:&mdash;If she obtains the object of her choice, on
him, as I have told you, will her father bestow affluence.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Whatever, sir, may be your pretensions to
eminence, and they may be many, the lady is not your inferior. Her
education also is such as would do honour to a gentleman of taste.</p>

<p>“I will not extend my remarks; you perfectly understand me&mdash;what
answer shall I return?”</p>

<p>Alonzo sighed: for a few moments he was silent.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, said the stranger, you may consider the <i>mode</i> of this
message as bearing the appearance of indecorum. If so, I&nbsp;presume,
on reviewing the incidents which <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">led</ins> to&mdash;which <i>enforced it</i>, as the most safe, the
<i>only</i> means of sure communication, you will change your opinion.
Probably you would not wish finally to decide until you have visited the
lady. This was my expectation, and I am, therefore, ready to introduce
you to her presence.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<p>“No, sir, said Alonzo, so far from considering the message
indecorous, I&nbsp;esteem it a peculiar honour, both as respects the
lady and yourself. Nor is it necessary that I should visit the lady, to
confirm the truth of what you have related. You will not, sir, receive
it as an adulatory compliment, when I say, that although our
acquaintance is short, yet my confidence in your integrity is such as to
require no corroborating facts to establish your declaration. But, sir,
there are obstacles, insuperable obstacles, to the execution of the
measures you would propose.</p>

<p>“Your frankness to me, demands, on my part, equal candour.
I&nbsp;assured you that I was unmarried, and had no prospect of entering
into matrimonial engagements; this is indeed the fact: but it is also
true that my affections&mdash;my first, my earliest affections were
engaged, unalienably engaged, to an object which is now no more. Perhaps
you may esteem it singular; <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘peahaps’">perhaps</ins> you will consider it enthusiasm; but, sir, it
is impossible that my heart should admit a second and similar
impression.”</p>

<p>The stranger paused. “Recent disappointments of this nature, he
replied, commonly leave the mind under such gloomy influences. Time,
however, the soother of severest woes, will, though slowly, yet
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
surely<ins class = "correction" title = "1851 . for ,">, </ins>disperse
the clouds of anguish, and the rays of comfort and consolation will beam
upon the soul. I&nbsp;wish not to be considered importunate, but the day
may arrive when you may change your present determination, and then will
you not regret that you refused so advantageous an overture?”</p>

<p>“That day will never arrive, sir answered Alonzo: I&nbsp;have had
time for deliberate reflection since the melancholy event took place.
I&nbsp;have experienced a sufficient change of objects and <ins class =
"other" title = "1804/11">of</ins> country; the effect is the same. The
wound is still recent, and so it will ever remain: indeed I cannot wish
it otherwise. There is a rich and sacred solemnity in my sorrows, sir,
which I would not exchange for the most splendid acquirements of wealth,
or the most dignified titles of fame.”</p>

<p>The young officer sat for some time silent. “Well, sir, he said,
since it is thus, seeing that these things are so, I&nbsp;will urge you
no farther. You will pardon me respecting the part I have taken in this
business, since it was with the purest designs. May consolation,
comfort, and happiness, yet be yours.”</p>

<p>“To you and your fair friend, said Alonzo, I&nbsp;consider myself
under the highest obligations. The gratitude I feel I can but
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
feebly express. Believe me, sir, when I tell you, (and it is all I can
say,) that your ingenuous conduct has left impressions in my bosom which
can never be obliterated.”</p>

<p>The stranger held out his hand, which Alonzo ardently grasped. They
were silent, but their eyes spoke sympathy, and they parted<ins class =
"correction" title = ". missing or invisible">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Alonzo immediately prepared, and was soon ready to depart. As he was
stepping into his carriage, he saw the young officer returning. As he
came up, “I&nbsp;must detain you a few moments longer, he said, and I
will give you no farther trouble. You will recollect that the lady about
whom I have so much teazed you, when she became <i>acquainted</i> with
you in her dream, believed that if she could speak with you, all
difficulties would be removed. Conscious that this may be the case, (for
with all her accomplishments she is a little superstitious,) she desires
to see you. You have nothing to fear, sir; she would not for the world
yield you her hand, unless in return you could give her your heart. Nor
was she willing you should know that she made this request, but wished
me to introduce you, as it were by stratagem. Confident, however, that
you would thus far yield to the caprice of a lady, I&nbsp;chose to tell
you the
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
truth. She resides near by, and it will not hinder you long.”</p>

<p>“It is capriciousness in the extreme,” thought Alonzo; but he told
the stranger he would accompany him&mdash;who immediately stepped into
the carriage, and they drove, by his direction, to an elegant house in a
street at a little distance, and alighted. As they entered the house,
a&nbsp;servant handed the stranger a note, which he hastily looked over:
“Tell the gentleman I will wait on him in a moment,” said he to the
servant, who instantly withdrew. Turning to Alonzo, “a&nbsp;person is in
waiting, said he, on urgent business; excuse me, therefore, if it is
with reluctance I retire a few moments, after I have announced you;
I&nbsp;will soon again be with you.”</p>

<p>They then ascended a flight of stairs: the stranger opened the door
of a chamber&mdash;“The gentleman I mentioned to you madam,” he said.
Alonzo entered; the stranger closed the door and retired. The lady was
sitting by a window at the lower end of the room, but arose as Alonzo
was announced. She was dressed in sky-blue silk, embroidered with
spangled lace; a&nbsp;gemmed <i>tiara</i> gathered her hair, from which
was suspended a green veil, according to the mode of those times;
a&nbsp;<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘silk’">silken</ins> girdle,
with diamond clasps, surrounded her waist, and
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
a brilliant sparkled upon her bosom. “The stranger’s description was not
exaggerated, thought Alonzo; for, except one, I&nbsp;have never seen a
more elegant figure:” and he almost wished the veil removed, that he
might behold her features.</p>

<p>“You will please to be seated, sir, she said. I&nbsp;know not
how&mdash;I feel an inconceivable diffidence in making an excuse for the
inconveniences my silly caprices have given you.”</p>

<p>Enchanting melody was in her voice! Alonzo knew not why, but it
thrilled his bosom, electrified his soul, and vibrated every nerve of
his heart. Confused and hurried sensations, melancholy, yet pleasing;
transporting as the recurrence of youthful joys, enrapturing as dreams
of early childhood, passed in rapid succession over his imagination!</p>

<p>She advanced towards him and turned aside her veil. Her eyes were
suffused, and tears streamed down her cheeks.&mdash;Alonzo
started&mdash;his whole frame shook&mdash;he gasped for breath!<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Melissa! he convulsively
exclaimed,&mdash;God of infinite wonders, it is Melissa!”</p>

<p>Again will the incidents of our history produce a pause. Our
sentimental readers will experience a recurrence of sympathetic
sensibilities, and will attend more
<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
eagerly to the final scene of our drama.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Melissa alive!” may they
say&mdash;“impossible! Did not Alonzo see her death <ins class = "other"
title = "1804/11">announced</ins> in the public prints? Did not her
cousin at New-London inform him of the circumstances, and was he not in
mourning? Did not the dying Beauman confirm the melancholy fact? And was
not the unquestionable testimony of her brother Edgar sufficient to seal
the truth of all <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">of</ins> this?
Did not the sexton’s wife who knew not Alonzo, corroborate it? And did
not Alonzo finally read her name, her age, and the time of her death, on
her tomb-stone, which exactly accorded with the publication of her death
in the papers, and his own knowledge of her age? And is not <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">all</ins> this sufficient to prove, clearly
and incontestibly prove, that she is dead? And yet here she is again, in
all her primitive beauty and splendour! No, this surely can never be.
However the author may succeed in <del class = "other"
title = "1804 omits">his</del> description, in painting reanimated nature, he is no
magician, or if he is, he cannot raise the dead.</p>

<p>“Melissa has long since mouldered into dust,<!-- uh, it’s been six
months, I&nbsp;think --> and he has raised up some female Martin Guerre,
or Thomas Hoag&mdash;some person, from whose near resemblance to the
deceased, he thinks to impose upon us and upon Alonzo also, for Melissa.
But it
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
will not do; it must be the identical Melissa herself, or it might as
well be her likeness in a marble statue. What! can Alonzo realize the
delicacies, the tenderness, the blandishments of Melissa in another? Can
her substitute point him to the rock on New London beach, the bower <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘of’">on</ins> her favourite hill, or so
feelingly describe the charms of nature? Can he, indeed, find in her
representative those alluring graces, that pensive sweetness, those
unrivalled virtues and matchless worth which he found in Melissa, and
which attracted, fixed and secured the youngest affections of his soul?
Impossible!<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Or could the author
even make it out that Alonzo was deceived by a person so nearly
resembling Melissa that he could not distinguish the difference, yet to
his readers he must unveil the deception, and, of course, the story will
end in disappointment; it will leave an unpleasant and disagreeable
impression on the mind of the reader, <!-- truer words... --> which in
novel writing is certainly wrong. It is proved as clearly as facts can
prove, that he has suffered Melissa to die; and since she is dead, it is
totally beyond his power to bring her to life<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>and so his history is intrinsically <i>good
for nothing</i><ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing or invisible">.”</ins> <!-- the Imagined Reader apparently has a thin grasp
on the concept of fiction --></p>

<p>Be not quite so hasty, my zealous censor. <!-- Don’t tell me what to
do, Jackson. --> Did we not tell you that we were detailing
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>

Have we not told you that disappointments are the lot of life? Have we
not, according to the advice of the moralist<ins class =

* <i>See <span class = "smallcaps">Barometer</span>, No.

led Alonzo to the temple of philosophy, the shrine of reason, and the
sanctuary of religion? If all these fail&mdash;if in these Alonzo cannot
find a balsam sufficient to heal his wounded bosom; then if, in despite
of graves and tomb-stones, Melissa will come to his relief&mdash;will
pour the balm of consolation over his anguished soul, cynical critic,
can the author help&nbsp;it?</p>

<p>It was indeed Melissa, the identical Melissa, whom Alonzo ascended a
tree to catch a last glimpse of, as she walked up the avenue to the old
mansion, after they had parted at the draw-bridge, on the morning of the
day when she was so mysteriously removed. “Melissa!”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Alonzo!”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>were all they could articulate: and frown
not, my fair readers, if we tell you that she was instantly in his arms,
while he pressed his ardent lips to her glowing cheek.</p>

<p>Sneer not, ye callous hearted insensibles, ye fastidious prudes, if
we inform you that their tears fell in one <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ‘immingling’">intermingling</ins> shower, that their sighs wafted
in one blended breeze.</p>

<p>The sudden opening of the door aroused them to a sense of their
improper situation; for who but must consider it <i>improper</i>
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
to find a young lady locked in the arms of a gentleman to whom she had
just been introduced? The opening of the door, therefore, caused them
quickly to change their <i>position</i>; not so hastily, however, but
that the young officer who then entered the room had a glimpse of their
situation.<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Aha! said he, have
I caught you? Is my philosophic Plato so soon metamorphosed to a <i>bon
ton</i> enamarato? But a few hours ago, sir, and you were proof against
the whole <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘arena’">arcana</ins> of
beauty, and all the artillery of the graces; but no sooner are you for
one moment <i>tete a tete</i> with a fashionable belle, than your
heroism and your resolutions are vanquished, your former ties dissolved,
and your deceased charmer totally forgotten or neglected, by the virtue
of a single glance. Well, so it is: <i>Amor vincit omnia</i> is my
motto; to thee all conquering beauty, our firmest determinations must
bow. I&nbsp;cannot censure you for discovering, though late, that one
living object is really of more intrinsic value than two dead ones.
Indeed, sir, I&nbsp;cannot but applaud your <ins class = "change" title
= "1804 ‘discrimination’">determination</ins>.”</p>

<p>“The laws of honour, said Alonzo, smiling, compel me to submit to
become the subject of your raillery and deception; I&nbsp;am in your
power.”</p>

<p>“I acknowledge, said the officer, that I
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
have a little deceived you, my story was fiction founded on
truth&mdash;the <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">true</ins>
novel style: but for the deceptive part, you may thank your little
gipsey of a nymph there, pointing to Melissa; she planned and I
executed.”</p>

<p>“How ready you <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘gentleman’">gentlemen</ins> are, replied Melissa, when accused of
impropriety, to cast the blame on the defenceless! So it was with our
first parents, and so it is still. But you must remember that Alonzo is
yet to hear my story; there, sir, I&nbsp;have the advantage of you.”</p>

<p>“<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘There’">Then</ins> I confess,
said he, looking at Alonzo, you will be too hard for me, and so I will
say no more about&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>Melissa then introduced the young officer to Alonzo, by the
appellation of Capt. Wilmot. “He is the son of <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘a’">my</ins> deceased uncle, said she, a&nbsp;cousin to
whom I am much indebted, as you shall hereafter know.”</p>

<p>A coach drove up to the door, which Melissa informed Alonzo was her
uncle’s, and was sent to convey Alfred and her home. “You will have no
objection to breakfast with me at my uncle’s, said Alfred, if it be only
to keep our cousin Melissa in countenance<ins class = "correction" title
= "close quote missing or invisible">.”</ins></p>

<p>Alonzo did not hesitate to accept the invitation: They immediately
therefore entered the coach, a&nbsp;servant took <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘charge’">care</ins> of Alonzo’s
<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
carriage, and they drove to the seat of Col. D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who, with his family, received Alonzo with
much friendship and politeness. Alfred had apprized them of Alonzo’s
arrival in town, and of course he was expected.</p>

<p>Col. D<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> was about fifty
years old, his manners were majestically grave, and commanding, yet
polished and polite. His family consisted of an amiable wife,
considerably younger than himself, and three children: the eldest<ins
class = "other" title = "1804">, a</ins> son, about ten years of age,
and two daughters, one seven, the other four years old. Harmony and
cheerfulness reigned in <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘this’">his</ins> family, which diffused tranquillity and ease to its
members and its guests.</p>

<p class = "right">

<p>It was agreed that Alonzo should pass a few days at the house of
Melissa’s uncle, when Melissa was to accompany him to Connecticut.
Alfred, with some other officers, was recruiting for the army, where his
regiment then lay, and which he was shortly to join. He could not,
therefore, be constantly at his uncle’s, though he was principally there
while Alonzo staid: but being absent the day after his arrival, Melissa
and Alonzo having retired to a room separate from the family, she gave
him the following account of what happened after they <del class =
"other" title = "1804 omits">had</del> parted at the old mansion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<p>“The morning after you left me, she said, John came to the bridge and
called to be let in:&mdash;I immediately went to the gate, opened it,
and let down the bridge. John informed me that my aunt had suddenly and
unexpectedly arrived that morning in company with a strange gentleman,
and that he had come for the keys, as my aunt was to visit the mansion
that day. I&nbsp;strove to persuade John to leave the keys in my
possession, and that I would make all easy with my aunt when she
arrived. This, though with much reluctance, he at length consented to,
and departed. Soon after this my aunt came, and without much ceremony
demanded the keys, insinuating that I had obtained them from John by
imposition, and for the basest purposes. This aroused me to indignation,
and I answered by informing her that whatever purposes the persecution
and cruelty of my family had compelled me to adopt, my conscience, under
present circumstances approved them, and I refused to give her the keys.
She then ordered me to prepare to leave the mansion, and accompany her
to her residence at the house of John. I&nbsp;told her that <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘as I had been placed there by my father, I’">I
had been placed there by my father, and</ins> should not consent to a
removal unless by his express orders. She then left me, intimating that
she would soon let me know
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
that her authority was not to be thus trampled upon with impunity.</p>

<p>“I immediately raised the bridge, and made fast the gate,
determining, on no considerations, to suffer it to be opened until
evening. The day passed away without any occurrence worthy of note, and
as soon as it was dark, I&nbsp;went, opened the gate, and cautiously let
down the bridge. I&nbsp;then returned to the mansion, and placed the
candle, as we had concerted, at the window. Shortly after I heard a
carriage roll over the bridge and proceed up the avenue.&mdash;My heart
fluttered; I&nbsp;wished&mdash;I hardly <ins class = "change" title =
"1804 ‘know’">knew</ins> what I did wish; but I feared I was about to
act improperly, as I had no other idea but that it was you, Alonzo, who
was approaching. The carriage stopped near the door of the mansion;
a&nbsp;footstep ascended the stairs. Judge of my surprise and agitation,
when my father entered the chamber! A&nbsp;maid and two men servants
followed him. He directed me to make immediate preparations for leaving
the mansion&mdash;which command, with the assistance of the servants,
I&nbsp;obeyed with a heart too full for utterance.</p>

<p>“As soon as I was ready, we entered the carriage, which drove rapidly
away. As we passed out of the gate, I&nbsp;looked back <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘to’">at</ins> the mansion, and saw the light of
the candle,
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
which I had forgotten to remove, streaming from the window, and it was
by an extraordinary effort that I prevented myself from fainting.</p>

<p>“The carriage drove, as near as I could judge, about ten miles, when
we stopped at an inn for the night, except my father, who returned home
on horseback, leaving me at the inn in company with the servants, where
the carriage also remained. The maid was a person who had been attached
to me from my infancy. I&nbsp;asked her whether she could explain these
mysterious proceedings.</p>

<p>“All I know, Miss, I will tell you, said she. Your father received a
letter to-day from your aunt, which put him in a terrible <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ‘fluster’">flutter</ins>:&mdash;he immediately
ordered his carriage and directed us to attend him. He met your aunt at
a tavern somewhere away back, and she told him that the gentleman who
used to come to our house so much once, had contrived to carry you off
from the place where you lived with her; so your father concluded to
send you to your uncle’s in Carolina, and said <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">that</del> I must go with you. And to tell you the
truth, Miss, I&nbsp;was not displeased with it; for your father has
grown so sour of late, that we have <ins class = "other"
title = "1870 only">but</ins> little peace in the house.</p>

<p>“By this I found that my fate was fixed, and I gave myself up for
some time to unavailing
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
sorrow. The maid informed me that my mother was well, which was one
sweet consolation among my many troubles; but she knew nothing of my
father’s late conduct.</p>

<p>“The next morning we proceeded, and I was hurried on by rapid stages
to the Chesapeak, where, with the maid and one man servant, I&nbsp;was
put on board a packet for Charleston, at which place we arrived in due
time.</p>

<p>“My uncle and his family received me with much tenderness: the
servant delivered a <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘packet’">package</ins> of letters to my uncle from my father. The
carriage with one servant (the driver) had returned from the Chesapeak
to Connecticut.</p>

<p>“My father had but one brother and two sisters, <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘or’">of</ins> which my uncle here is the
youngest. One of my aunts, the old maid, who was my <i>protectress</i>
at the old mansion, you have seen at my father’s. The other was the
mother of Alfred:&mdash;she married very young, to a gentleman in
Hartford, of the name of Wilmot, who fell before the walls of Louisburg,
in the old French war. My aunt did not long survive him;&mdash;her
health, which had been for some time declining, received so serious a
shock by this catastrophe, that she died a few months after the
melancholy tidings <ins class = "correction"
title = ", invisible">arrived,</ins> leaving Alfred,
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
their only child<ins class = "correction"
title = "comma uncertain: word spacing looks like ‘child then, an infant’">,&nbsp;then</ins> an infant,
to the protection of his relations, who as soon as he arrived at a
suitable age, placed him at school.</p>

<p>“My grandfather, who had the principal management of Mr. Wilmot’s
estate, sent my uncle, who was then young and unmarried, to Hartford,
for the purpose of transacting the necessary business. Here he became
acquainted with a young lady, eminent for beauty and loveliness, but
without fortune, the daughter of a poor mechanic. As soon as my
grandfather was informed of this attachment, he, in a very peremptory
manner, ordered my uncle to break off the connection on pain of his
highest displeasure. But such is the force of early impressions,
(Melissa sighed) that my uncle found it impossible to submit to these
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘stern’">firm</ins> injunctions;
a&nbsp;clandestine marriage ensued, and my grandfather’s <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘malediction’">maledictions</ins> in consequence.
The union was, however, soon dissolved; my uncle’s wife died in about
twelve months after their marriage, and soon after the birth of <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ‘their’">the</ins> first child, which was
a daughter. Inconsolable and comfortless, my uncle put the child <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">out</del> to nurse, and travelled
to the south. After wandering about for some time, he took up his
residence in Charleston, where he amassed a splendid fortune. He finally
married to an amiable <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">and
respectable</del> woman, whose tenderness,
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
though it did not entirely remove, yet <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">soon</ins> greatly alleviated the pangs of early sorrow; and
this, added to the little blandishments of a young family, fixed him in
a state of more contentedness than he once ever expected to see.</p>

<p>“His daughter by his first wife, when she became of proper age, was
sent to a respectable boarding-school in Boston, where she remained
until within about two years before I came here.</p>

<p>“Alfred was educated at Harvard College: as soon as he had graduated,
he came here on my uncle’s request, and has since remained in his
family.</p>

<p>“Soon after I arrived here; my uncle came into my chamber one day.
<ins class = "correction" title = ", invisible">“Melissa,</ins> said he,
I&nbsp;find by your father’s letters <ins class = "correction" title =
"final ‘t’ invisible">that</ins> he considers you <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">to</del> have formed an improper connection.
I&nbsp;wish you to give me a true statement of the matter, and if any
thing can be done to reconcile you to your father, you may depend upon
my assistance. I&nbsp;have seen some troubles in <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘that’">this</ins> way myself, in my early days; perhaps
my <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘council’">counsel</ins> may be
of some service.”</p>

<p>“I immediately gave <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">him</ins> a correct account of every particular circumstance, from
the time of my first acquaintance with you until my arrival at <ins
class = "change" title = "1804 ‘his’">this</ins> house. He sat some time
silent, and then told me that my
<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
father, he believed, had drawn the worst side of the picture; and that
he had urged him to exert every means in his power to reclaim me to
obedience: That Beauman was to follow me in a few months, and that, if I
still <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘refuse’">refused</ins> to
yield him my hand, my father positively and solemnly declared that he
would discard me forever, and strenuously enjoined it upon him to do the
same. “I&nbsp;well know my brother’s temper, continued my uncle; the
case is difficult, but something must be done. I&nbsp;will immediately
write to your father, <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘advising’">desiring</ins> him not to proceed too rashly; in the mean
time we must consider what measures to pursue. You must not, my niece,
you must not be sacrificed.” So saying, he left me, highly consoled
that, instead of a tyrant, I&nbsp;had found a friend in my new
protector.</p>

<p>“Alfred was made acquainted with <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘my’">the</ins> affair, and many were the plans projected for my
benefit, and abandoned as indefeasible, till an event happened which
called forth all the fortitude of my uncle to support it, and operated
in the end to free me from persecution.</p>

<p>“My uncle’s daughter, by his first wife, was of a very delicate and
sickly constitution, and her health evidently <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘decreasing after’">decreasing. After</ins> she came to
this place, she was sent to a village on one of the high hills of Pedee,
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
where she remained a considerable time; she then went to one of the
inland towns in North Carolina, from whence she had but just returned
with Alfred when I arrived. Afterwards I accompanied her to Georgetown,
and other places, attended by her father, so that she was little more
known in Charleston than myself. But all answered no purpose to the
restoration of her health; a&nbsp;confirmed hectic carried her off in
the bloom of youth.</p>

<p>“I was but a few months older than she; her name was Melissa,
a&nbsp;name which a pious grandmother had borne, and was <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘thereafter’">therefore</ins> retained in the
family. Our similarity of age, and in some measure of appearance, our
being so little known in Charleston, and our names being the same,
suggested to Alfred the idea of imposing on my father, by passing off my
cousin’s death as my own. This would, at least, deter Beauman from
prosecuting his intended journey to Charleston; it would also give time
for farther deliberation, and might so operate on my father’s feelings
as to soften that obduracy of temper, which deeply disquieted himself
and others, and thus finally be productive of happily effecting the
designed purpose.</p>

<p>“My uncle was too deeply overwhelmed in grief to be particularly
consulted on this
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
plan. He however entrusted Alfred to act with full powers, and to use
his name for my interest, if necessary. Alfred therefore procured a
publication, as of my death, in the Connecticut papers, particularly at
New London, the native place of Beauman. In Charleston it was <ins class
= "other" title = "1804/11">also</ins> generally supposed that it was
the niece, and not the daughter of Col. D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who had died.&mdash;This imposition was
likewise practised <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘on’">upon</ins>
the sexton, who keeps the register of deaths.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagM" id = "tagM" href = "#noteM">*</a> Alfred then wrote a letter to
my father, in my uncle’s name, stating the particulars of my cousin’s
death, and applying them to me. The epitaph on her tombstone was
likewise so devised that it would with equal propriety apply either to
her or to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteM" id = "noteM" href = "#tagM">*</a>
This was formerly the case.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page218" id = "page218"> </a>

<p>“To undeceive you, Alonzo, continued Melissa, was the next object.
I&nbsp;consulted with Alfred how this should be done.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“My sister, he said, (in our private circles
he always called me by the tender name of sister,) I&nbsp;am determined
to see you happy before I relinquish the business I have undertaken:
letters are a precarious mode of communication; I&nbsp;will make a
journey to Connecticut, find out Alonzo, visit your friends, and see how
the plan operates. I&nbsp;<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
am known to your father, who has ever treated me as a relative. <!-- but
... he is... --> I will return as speedily as possible, and we shall
then know what measures are best next to pursue.”</p>

<p>“I requested him to unfold the deception to my mother, and, if he
found it expedient, to Vincent and Mr. Simpson, in whose friendship and
fidelity I was sure he might safely confide.</p>

<p>“He soon departed, and returned in about two months. He found my
father and mother in extreme distress on account of my supposed death:
my mother’s grief had brought her on <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">to</ins> the bed of sickness; but when Alfred had undeceived her
she rapidly revived. My father told Alfred that he seriously regretted
opposing my inclinations, and that, were it possible he could retrace
the steps he had taken, he should conduct in a very different manner, as
he was not only deprived of <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘you’">me</ins>, but Edgar also, who had gone to Holland in an official
capacity, soon after receiving the tidings of my death. “I&nbsp;am now
childless,” said my father in tears. Alfred’s feelings were moved, and
could he then have found you, he would have told my father the truth;
but lest he should relapse from present determinations, he considered it
his duty still with him, to continue the deception.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
<p>“On enquiring at your father’s, at Vincent’s, and at <ins class =
"correction" title = ". missing">Mr.</ins> Simpson’s, he could learn
nothing of you, except that you had gone <ins class = "other" title =
"1804 only">in search of me. Vincent conjectured that you had gone</ins>
to New London, judging possibly that you would find me there. Alfred
therefore determined to proceed to that place immediately. He then <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘confidently’">confidentially</ins>
unfolded to your father, Vincent, and Mr. Simpson, the scheme, desiring
that if you returned you would proceed immediately to Charleston. My
father was still to be kept in ignorance.</p>

<p>“Alfred proceeded immediately to New London: from my cousin there he
was informed of your interview with him; but from whence you then came,
<ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘to’">or</ins> where you went, he
knew not; and after making the strictest enquiry, he could hear nothing
more of you. By a vessel in that port, bound directly for Holland, he
wrote an account of the whole affair to Edgar, mentioning his
unsuccessful search to find you; and returned to Charleston.</p>

<p>“Alfred learnt from my friends the circumstances which occasioned my
sudden removal from the old mansion. The morning you left me you was
discovered by my aunt, who was passing the road in a chair with a
gentleman, whom she had then but recently become acquainted with. My
aunt <ins class = "correction" title = "1851 ‘know’">knew</ins> you.
They immediately drove
<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
to John’s hut. On finding that John had left the keys with me, she sent
him for them; and on my refusing to give them up, she came herself, as I
have before related; and as she succeeded no better than John, she <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘returned, ’">returned and</ins>
dispatched a message to my father, <ins class = "change" title =
"1804/11 ‘informed’">informing</ins> him of the circumstances, and her
suspicions of your having been to the mansion, and that, from my having
possession of the keys and refusing to yield them up, there was little
doubt but that we had formed a plan for my escape.</p>

<p>“Alarmed at this information, my father immediately ordered his
carriage, drove to the mansion, and removed me, as I have before
informed you<ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 superfluous close quote">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“I ought to have told you, that the maid and man servant who attended
me to Charleston, not liking the country, and growing sickly, were sent
back by my uncle, after they had been there about two months.”</p>

<p>Alonzo found by this <ins class = "correction"
title = "1804/1851/70 ‘narative’">narrative</ins> that John had deceived him, when he made his
enquiries of him concerning his knowledge of Melissa’s removal. But this
was not surprising: John was tenant to Melissa’s aunt, and subservient
to all her views;&mdash;she had undoubtedly given him <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘his lesson’">instructions</ins> how to act.</p>

<p>“But who was the strange gentleman
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
with your aunt?” enquired Alonzo. “This I will also tell you, answered
Melissa, <ins class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘though’">tho’</ins> it
unfolds a tale which reflects no great honour to my family.</p>

<p>“Hamblin was the name which this man assumed: he said he had been an
eminent merchant in New York, and had left it about the time it was
taken by the British. He lodged at an inn where my aunt frequently
stopped when she was out collecting her rents, where he first introduced
himself to her acquaintance, and ingratiated himself into her favour by
art and insidiousness. He accompanied her on her visits to her tenants,
and assisted her in collecting her rents. He told her, that when the war
came on, he had turned his effects into money, which he had with him,
and was now in pursuit of some country place where he might purchase a
residence to remain during the war. To cut the story as short as
possible, he <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">finally</del>
initiated himself so far in my aunt’s favour that she accepted his hand,
and, contrary to my father’s opinion, she married him, and he soon after
persuaded her to sell her property, under pretence of removing to some
populous town, and living in style. Her property, however, was no sooner
sold (which my father bought for ready cash, at a low
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
price) than he found means to realize the money, and absconded.</p>

<p>“It was afterwards found <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">out</ins> that his real name was Brenton; that he had <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">left</del> a wife and family in Virginia in
indigent circumstances, where he had spent an ample fortune, left him by
his father, in debauchery, and involved himself deeply in debt. He had
scarcely time to get off with the booty he swindled from my aunt, when
his creditors from Virginia were at his heels. He fled to the British at
New York, where he rioted for a few months, was finally stabbed by a
soldier in a fracas, and died the next day. He was about thirty-five
years old.</p>

<p>“All these troubles bore so heavily upon my aunt, that she went into
a decline, and died about six months ago.</p>

<p>“After Alfred returned from Connecticut, he wrote frequently to
Vincent and Mr. Simpson, but could obtain no intelligence concerning
you. It would be needless, Alonzo, to describe my conjectures, my
anxieties, my feelings! The death of my cousin and aunt had kept me in
crape <!-- =D --> until, at the instance of Alfred, I&nbsp;put it off
yesterday morning at my uncle’s house <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">in town</ins>, which Alfred had proposed for the scene of action,
after he had discovered the cause of my fainting at the theatre.
I&nbsp;did not readily
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
come into Alfred’s plan to deceive you: “Suffer me, he said, to try the
constancy of your <i>Leander</i>;<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I doubt whether he would swim the Hellespont
for you.“<!-- maybe because he found out what happened to Leander -->
This aroused my pride and confidence, and I permitted him to
proceed.”</p>

<p>Alonzo then gave <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘Mellissa’">Melissa</ins> a minute account of all that <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">had</ins> happened to him from the time of
their parting at the old mansion until he met with her the day before.
At the mention of Beauman’s fate Melissa sighed. “With how many vain
fears, said she, was I perplexed, lest, by some means he should discover
my existence and place of residence, after he, alas, was silent in the
tomb!”</p>

<p>Alonzo told Melissa that he had received a letter from Edgar, after
he arrived in Holland, and that he had written him an answer, just as he
left Paris, informing him of his reasons for returning to America.</p>

<p>When the time arrived that Alonzo and Melissa were to set out for
Connecticut, Melissa’s uncle and Alfred accompanied them as far as
Georgetown, where an affectionate parting took place: The latter
returned to Charleston, and the former proceeded on their journey.</p>

<p>Philadelphia was now in possession of the British troops. Alonzo
found <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘Doctor’">Dr.</ins> Franklin’s
agent at Chester, transacted his business,
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
went on, arrived at Vincent’s where he left Melissa, and proceeded
immediately to his father’s<ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing or invisible">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>The friends of Alonzo and Melissa were joyfully surprised at their
arrival. Melissa’s mother was sent for to Vincent’s. Let imagination
paint the meeting! As yet however they were not prepared to <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘undecieve’">undeceive</ins> her father.</p>

<p>Alonzo found his parents in penurious circumstances; indeed, his
father having the preceeding summer, been too indisposed to manage his
little farm with attention, and being unable to hire laborers, his <ins
class = "correction" title = "1851 ‘crobs’">crops</ins> had <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘yeilded’">yielded</ins> but a scanty supply,
and he had been compelled to sell most of his stock to answer pressing
demands. With great joy they welcomed Alonzo<ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 . for ,">, </ins>whom they had given up as lost. “You
still find your father poor, Alonzo, said the old gentleman, but you
find him still honest.&mdash;From my inability to labour, we have
latterly been a little more pressed than usual; but having now recovered
my health, I&nbsp;trust <del class = "other"
title = "1804/11 omit">that</del> that difficulty will soon be removed.”</p>

<p>Alonzo asked his father if he <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘had ever known’">ever knew</ins> <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘Doctor’">Dr.</ins> Franklin.</p>

<p>“We were school-mates, he replied<ins class = "correction"
title = ", missing">, </ins>and were intimately acquainted after we became young
men in business for ourselves.
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
We have done each other favours; I&nbsp;once divided my money with
Franklin on an urgent occasion to him; he afterwards repaid me with
ample interest&mdash;he will never forget&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>Alonzo then related to his father all the incidents of his travels,
minutely particularizing the disinterested conduct of Franklin, and then
presented his father with the reversion of his estate. The old man fell
on his knees, and with tears streaming down his withered cheeks, offered
devout thanks to the great Dispenser of all mercies.</p>

<p>Alonzo then visited Melissa’s father, who received him with much
complacency. “I&nbsp;have injured, said he, my young friend, deeply
injured you; but in doing this, I&nbsp;have inflicted a wound still
deeper <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘on’">in</ins> my own
bosom.”</p>

<p>Alonzo desired him not to renew his sorrows. “What is past, said he,
is beyond recal; but a subject of some importance to me, is the object
of my present visit.&mdash;True it is, that your daughter was the <ins
class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘subject’">object</ins> of my earliest
affection&mdash;an affection which my bosom must ever retain<ins class =
"correction" title = "; invisible">;&nbsp;</ins>but being separated by
the will of Providence&mdash;for I view Providence as overruling all
events for wise purposes&mdash;I betook myself to travel. Time, you know
it is said, sir, will blunt the sharpest thorns of sorrow.&mdash;[The
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
old man sighed.]<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>In my travels
I have found a lady so nearly resembling your daughter, that I was
induced to sue for her hand, and have been so happy as to gain the
promise of it. The favour I have to ask of you, sir, is only that you
will permit the marriage ceremony to be celebrated in your house, as you
know my father is poor, his house small and inconvenient, and that you
will also honour me by giving the lady away. In receiving her from your
hands, I&nbsp;shall in some measure realize former <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">happy</ins> anticipations; I&nbsp;shall receive her
in the character of Melissa.”</p>

<p>“Ah! said Melissa’s father, were it in my power&mdash;could I <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">but</del> give you the original;
But how vain that wish! Yes, my young friend, your request shall be
punctually complied with: I&nbsp;will take upon myself the preparations.
Name your day, and if the lady is portionless, in that she shall be to
me a Melissa.”</p>

<p>Alonzo bowed his <del class = "other" title = "1804/11 omit">head
in</del> gratitude; and after appointing that day week, <del class =
"other" title = "1804/11 omit">he</del> departed.</p>

<p>Invitations were once more sent abroad for the wedding of Alonzo and
Melissa.&mdash;Few indeed knew it to be the real Melissa, but they were
generally informed of Alonzo’s <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘reason,s’ 1870 ‘reason,’ [with comma]">reasons</ins> for preferring the
celebration at her father’s<ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing or invisible">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<p>The evening before the day on which the marriage was to take place,
Alonzo and Melissa were sitting with the Vincents in an upper room, when
a person rapped <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘to’">at</ins> the
door below. Vincent went down, and immediately returned, introducing, to
the joy and surprise of the company, Edgar!</p>

<p>Here, again, we shall leave it for the imagination to depict the
scene of an affectionate brother, meeting a tender and only sister, whom
he had long since supposed to be dead! He had been at his father’s, and
his mother had let him into the secret, when he immediately hastened to
Vincent’s. He told them that he did not stay long in Holland; that after
receiving Alonzo’s letter from Paris, he felt an unconquerable
propensity to return, and soon sailed for America, arrived at Boston,
came to New-Haven, took orders in the ministry, and had reached home
that day. He informed them that Mr. Simpson and family had arrived at
his father’s, and some relatives whom his mother had invited.</p>

<p>The next morning ushered in the day in which the hero and heroine of
our story were to consummate their felicity. No <i>cross purposes</i>
stood ready to intervene their happiness, <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">no determined rival,</ins> no obdurate father, no watchful,
scowling aunt, to interrupt their transports. It was the latter end of
May; nature was
<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
arrayed in her richest ornaments, and adorned with her sweetest
perfumes. The sun <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘blendid’">blended</ins> its mild lustre with the <ins class = "change"
title = "1811 ‘landscapes’’">landscape’s</ins> lovely green; silk-winged
breezes frolicked amidst the flowers; the spring birds <ins class =
"correction" title = "1851 ‘carroled’">carolled</ins> in varying
strains:</p>

<p class = "verse">
“The air was fragrance, and the world was love.”</p>

<p>Evening was appointed for the ceremony, and Edgar was to be the
officiating clergyman.</p>

<p class = "verse">
“To tie those bands which nought but death can sever.”</p>

<p>When the hour arrived, they repaired to the house of Melissa’s
father, where numerous guests had assembled. Melissa was introduced into
the bridal apartment, and took her seat among a brilliant circle of
ladies. She was attired in robes “white as the southern clouds,”
spangled with silver, and trimmed with deep gold lace; her hair hung
loosely upon her shoulders, encircled by a wreath of <del class =
"other" title = "1804 omits">artificial</del> flowers. She had regained
all her former loveliness; the rose and the lily again blended their
tinges in her cheek; again <i>pensive sprightliness</i> sparkled in her
eye.</p>

<p>Alonzo was now introduced, and took his seat at the side of Melissa.
His father and mother came next, who were placed at the right hand of
the young couple: Melissa’s
<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
parents followed, and were stationed at the left. Edgar then came and
took his seat in front; after which the guests were summoned, who filled
the room. Edgar then rising, <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘mentioned’">motioned</ins> to the intended bride and bridegroom to rise
also. He next turned to Alonzo’s father for his sanction, who bowed
assent. Then addressing his own father, with emotions that scarcely
suffered him to articulate. “Do you, sir, said he, give this lady to
that gentleman?” A&nbsp;solemn silence prevailed in the room. Melissa
was extremely agitated, as her father slowly rising, and with down-cast
eyes,</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Where tides of heavy <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘sorrows’">sorrow</ins> swell’d,”</p>

<p>took her trembling hand, and conveying it into Alonzo’s, “May the
smiles of heaven rest upon you, he said; may future blessings crown your
present happy prospects; and may your latter days never be embittered by
the premature loss of near and dear<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>Pungent grief here choaked his utterance, and at this moment Melissa,
falling upon her knees, “Dear father! she exclaimed, bursting into
tears, pardon deception; acknowledge your daughter&mdash;your own
Melissa!”</p>

<p>Her father started&mdash;he gazed at her with scrutinizing attention,
and sunk back in his
<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
chair.&mdash;“My daughter! he cried&mdash;God of mysterious mercy! it is
my daughter!”</p>

<p>The guests caught the contagious sympathy; convulsive sobs arose from
all parts of the room. Melissa’s father clasped her in his
arms&mdash;“And <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">do</ins> I
receive thee <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">as</del> from the
dead! he said. I&nbsp;am anxious to hear the <del class = "other" title
= "1804 omits">mighty</del> mystery unfolded. But first let the solemn
rites for which we are assembled be concluded; let not an old man’s
anxiety interrupt the ceremony.”</p>

<p>“But you are apprised, sir, said Alonzo, of my inability to support
your daughter according to her deserts.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me, my young friend, replied her father. I&nbsp;have
enough: my children are restored, and I am happy.”</p>

<p>Melissa soon resumed her former station. The indissoluble knot was
tied: they sat down to the wedding feast, and mirth and hilarity danced
in cheerful circles.</p>

<p>Before the company retired, Edgar related the most prominent
incidents of Alonzo and Melissa’s history, since they had been absent.
The guests listened with attention: they applauded the conduct of our
new bride and bridegroom, in which Melissa’s father cordially joined.
They rejoiced to find that Alonzo’s father had regained his fortune, and
copious libations were
<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
poured forth in honour of the immortal Franklin.</p>

<p>And now, reader of sensibility, indulge the pleasing sensations of
thy bosom&mdash;for Alonzo and Melissa are <span class =

<p>Alonzo’s father was soon in complete repossession of his former
property. The premises from which he had been driven by his unfeeling
creditors, were yielded up without difficulty, and to which he
immediately removed. He not only recovered the principal of the fortune
he had lost, but the damages and the interest; so that, although like
Job, he had seen <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘afflictions’">affliction</ins>, like him his latter days were better
than his beginning. But wearied with the <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ‘business’">bustles</ins> of life, he did not again enter into the
mercantile business, but placing his money at interest in safe hands,
lived retired on his little farm.</p>

<p>A few days after the wedding, as Melissa was sitting with Alonzo,
Edgar and her parents, she asked her father whether the old mansion was
inhabited.</p>

<p>“Not by human beings, he replied.<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Since it has fallen into my hands I have
leased it to three or four different families, who all <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">soon</ins> left it under <del class =
"other" title = "1870 omits">the</del> foolish pretence or impression of
hearing noises and seeing frightful objects, and such is the
superstition of <del class = "other" title = "1804/11 omit">the</del>
people that no one now, will
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
venture to try it again, though I suppose its inhabitants to consist
only of rats and mice.”</p>

<p>Melissa then informed them of all that had happened when she was
there, the alarming noises and horrible appearances she had been witness
to, and in which she was confident her senses had not deceived her.
Exceedingly astonished at her relation; it was agreed that Edgar and
Alonzo, properly attended, should proceed to the mansion, in order to
find whether any discoveries could be made which might <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘lead’">tend</ins> to the elucidation of so
mysterious an affair.</p>

<p>For this purpose they chose twenty men, armed them with muskets and
swords,<!-- uh, are they going to stab the ghosts? --> and proceeded to
the place, where they arrived in the dusk of the evening, having chosen
that season as the most favourable to their designs.</p>

<p>They found the drawbridge up, and the gate locked, as Edgar’s father
said he had left them. They entered and secured them in the same manner.
When they came to the house, they cautiously unlocked the door, and
proceeded to the chamber, where they struck a fire and <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘lit’">lighted</ins> candles, which they <del
class = "other" title = "1870 omits">had</del> brought with them. It was
then agreed to plant fifteen of the men at suitable distances around the
mansion, and
<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
retain five in the chamber with Alonzo and Edgar.</p>

<p>The men, who were placed around the house, were stationed behind
trees, stumps or rocks, and where no <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘objects’">object</ins> presented, <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">they</ins> lay flat on the ground, with orders not to stir, or
<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">to</ins> discover themselves,
let what would ensue, unless some alarm should be given from the
house.</p>

<p>Alonzo and Edgar were armed with pistols and side arms, and posted
themselves with the five men in the chamber, taking care that the lights
should not shine against the window shutters, so that nothing <ins class
= "change" title = "1804 ‘should’">could</ins> be discovered from
without. Things thus arranged, they observed almost <del class = "other"
title = "1870 omits">an</del> implicit silence, no one being allowed to
speak, except in a low whisper.</p>

<p>For a long time no <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘sounds were’">sound was</ins> heard except the hollow roar of <ins class =
"other" title = "1870 only">the</ins> winds in the neighbouring forest,
their whistling around the angles of the mansion, or the hoarse <ins
class = "change" title = "1804/11/70 ‘murmurs’">murmers</ins> of the
distant surge. The night was dark, and only illuminated by the feeble
twinkling of half clouded stars.</p>

<p>They had watched until about midnight, when they were alarmed by
noises in the rooms below, among which they could distinguish footsteps
and human voices. Alonzo and Edgar, then taking each a pistol in one
hand, and a drawn sword in the other,
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
ordered their men to follow them, prepared for action. Coming to the
head of the stairs, they saw a brilliant light streaming into the hall;
they therefore concluded to take no candles, and to prevent discovery
<del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">they</del> took off their
shoes. When they came into the hall opposite the door of the room from
whence the light and noises proceeded, they discovered ten men genteelly
dressed, sitting around a table, on which was placed a considerable
quantity of gold and silver coin, a&nbsp;number of glasses and several
decanters of wine. Alonzo and his party stood a few minutes, listening
to the following discourse, which took place among this <i>ghostly</i>
gentry.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, we have made a fine haul this trip.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Yes, but poor Bob, though, was plump’d over
by the d<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>d skulkers!”<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Aye, and had we not tugged bravely
at the oars, they would have hook’d us.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“<ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘Those rascally’">Rascally</ins> cow-boys detained us too long.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“Well, <ins class = "other" title =
"1804/11">well,</ins> never mind it; let us knock around the wine, and
then divide the spoil.”</p>

<p>At this moment, Alonzo and Edgar, followed by the five men, rushed
into the room, crying. “<i>Surrender, or you are all dead men!</i>” In
an instant the room was involved in pitchy darkness; a&nbsp;loud crash
was heard, then a scampering about the floor, and a noise as if several
doors shut
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘too’">to</ins>, with violence. They
however gave the <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘signal’">alarm</ins> to the men without, by loudly shouting “<i>Look
out</i>;” and immediately the discharge of several guns was heard around
the mansion. One of the men flew up stairs and brought a light; but, to
their utter amazement, no person was to be discovered in the room except
their own party. The table, with its apparatus, and the chairs on which
these now invisible beings had sat, had <ins class = "other" title =
"1804 only">all</ins> disappeared, not a single trace of them being
left.</p>

<p>While they stood petrified with astonishment, the men from without
called for admittance. The door being unlocked, they led in a stranger
wounded, whom they immediately discovered to be one of those they had
seen at the table.</p>

<p>The men who had been stationed around the mansion informed, that some
time before the alarm was made, they saw a number of persons crossing
the yard from the western part of the enclosure, towards the house; that
immediately after the shout was given, they discovered several people
running back in the same direction: they hailed them, which being
disregarded, they fired upon them, one of whom they brought down, which
was the wounded man they had brought in. The others, though they pursued
<ins class = "correction" title = ", invisible">them,</ins> got off.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">237</span>
<p>The prisoner’s wound was not dangerous, the ball had shattered his
arm, and glanced upon his breast. They dressed his wound as well as they
could, and then requested him to unfold the circumstances of the
suspicious appearance in which he was involved.</p>

<p>“First promise me, on your honour, said the stranger, that you will
use your influence to prevent my being punished or imprisoned.”</p>

<p>This they readily agreed to, on condition that he would conceal
nothing from them&mdash;and he gave them the following relation:</p>

<p>That they were <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">a</del> part
of a gang of <i>illicit traders</i>; men who had combined for the
purpose of carrying on a secret and illegal commerce with the British
army on Long Island, whom, contrary to the existing laws, they supplied
with provisions, and brought off English goods, which they sold at <ins
class = "change" title = "1804/11 ‘a very extortionate price’">very
extortionate prices</ins>. But this was not all; they also brought over
large quantities of counterfeit continental money, which they put off
among the <ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 ‘American’s’">Americans</ins> for live stock, poultry, produce, &amp;c.
which they carried to the Island. The counterfeit money they purchased
by merely paying for the printing; the British having obtained copies of
the American emission, struck
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
immense <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘sums’ 1870 ‘quanties’">quantities</ins> of it in New-York, and insidiously sent it
out into the country, in order to sink our currency.</p>

<p>This gang was likewise connected with the cow-boys, who made it their
business to steal, not only milch cows, and other cattle, but also hogs
and sheep, which they drove by night to some convenient place on the
shores of the Sound, where these <i>thief-partners</i> received them,
and conveyed them to the British.</p>

<p>“In our excursions across the Sound, continued the wounded man, we
had frequently observed this mansion, which, from every appearance, we
were convinced was uninhabited:&mdash;we therefore selected it as a
suitable place for our future rendezvous, which had <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11/70 ‘heretofore’">therefore</ins> been only in
the open woods. To cross the moat, we dragged up an old canoe from the
sea shore, which we concealed in the bushes as soon as we recrossed from
the <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">old</del> mansion. To get
over the wall we used ladders of ropes, placing a flat <ins class =
"other" title = "1804 only">piece</ins> of thick board on the top of the
spikes driven into the wall. We found more difficulty in getting into
the house:&mdash;we however at length succeeded, by tearing away a part
of the back wall, where we fitted in a door so exactly, and so nicely
painted it, that it could not be distinguished from the wall itself.
This door was so
<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
constructed, that on touching a spring, it would <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">suddenly</ins> fly open, and when unrestrained,
would shut <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘too’">to</ins> with
violence. Finding the apartment so eligible for our purpose, and fearing
that at some future time we might be disturbed either by the owner of
the building or some tenant, we cut similar doors into every room of the
house, so that on <del class = "other" title = "1804 omits">an</del>
emergency we could traverse every apartment without access to the known
doors. Trap-doors on a similar construction, communicated with the
cellar:&mdash;the table, which you saw us sitting around, stood on one
of <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘these’">those</ins>, which, on
your abrupt appearance, as soon as the candles were extinguished, was
with its contents, precipitated below, and we made our escape by those
secret doors, judging, that although you had seen us, if we could get
off, you would be unable to find out any thing which might lead to our
discovery.</p>

<p>“A circumstance soon occurred, which tended to embarrass our plans,
and at first seemed to menace their overthrow. Our assembling at the
mansion was irregular, as occasion and circumstances required; often not
more than once a week, but sometimes more frequent, and always in the
night.&mdash;Late one night, as we were proceeding to the mansion, and
had arrived near it, suddenly one of the chamber windows was
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
opened and a light issued from within. We entered the house with
caution, and soon discovered that some person was in the chamber from
whence we had seen the light. We remained until all was silent, and then
entered the chamber by one of our secret doors, and to our inexpressible
surprise, beheld a beautiful young lady asleep <ins class = "change"
title = "1804 ‘in’">on</ins> the only bed in the room. We cautiously
retired, and reconnoitering all parts of the mansion, found <del class =
"other" title = "1804/11 omit">that</del> she was the only inhabitant
except ourselves. The singularity of her being there alone, is a
circumstance we have never been able to discover, but it gave us fair
hopes of easily procuring her ejectment. We then immediately withdrew,
and made preparations to dispossess the fair tenant of <del class =
"other" title = "1804/11 omit">the</del> premises to which we considered
ourselves more properly entitled, as possessing a prior incumbency.</p>

<p>“We did not effect the completion of our apparatus under three or
four days. As soon as <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘they’">we</ins> were prepared, we returned to the mansion. As we
approached the house, it appears the lady heard us, for again she
suddenly flung up a window and held out a candle: we skulked from the
light, but feared she had a glimpse of us.&mdash;After we had got into
the house we were still until we
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
supposed her to be asleep, which we found to be the case on going to her
chamber.</p>

<p>“We then stationed one near her bed, who, by a loud rap <ins class =
"change" title = "1804 ‘upon’">on</ins> the floor with a cane, appeared
to arouse her in a fright. Loud noises were then made below, and some of
them ran heavily up the stairs which led to her chamber; the person
stationed in the room whispering near her bed&mdash;she raised herself
up, and he fled behind the curtains. Soon after she again lay down; he
approached nearer the bed with a design to lay his hand, on which he had
drawn a thin sheet-lead glove, across her face; but discovering her arm
on the out side of the bedclothes, he grasped it&mdash;she screamed and
sprang up in the bed; the man then left the room.</p>

<p>“As it was not our intention to injure the lady, but only to drive
her from the house, we concluded we had sufficiently alarmed her, and
having extinguished the lights, were about to depart, when we heard her
descending the stairs. She came down and examined the doors, when one of
our party, in a loud whisper, crying ”<i>away! away</i>;” she darted up
stairs, and we left the house.</p>

<p>“We did not return the next night, in order to give her time to get
off; but the night after we again repaired to the mansion,
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
expecting that she had gone, but we were disappointed. As it was late
when we arrived, she was wrapped in sleep, and we found that more
forcible measures must be resorted to before we could remove her, and
for such measures we were amply prepared<ins class = "correction" title
= "close quote missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>The stranger then unfolded the mysteries of that awful night, when
Melissa was so terrified by horrible appearances. One of the tallest and
most robust of the gang, was attired, as has been described, when he
appeared by her bed side. The white robe was an old sheet, stained in
some parts with a liquid red mixture; the wound in his breast was
artificial, and the blood issuing therefrom was only some of this
mixture, pressed from a small bladder, concealed under his robe. On his
head and face he wore a mask, with glass eyes<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>the mask was painted to suit their purposes.
The bloody dagger was of wood, and painted.</p>

<p>Thus accoutred, he took his stand near Melissa’s bed, having first
blown out the candles she had left burning, and discharged a small
pistol. Perceiving this had <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘awaked’">awakened</ins> her, a&nbsp;train of powder was fired in the
adjoining room opposite the secret door, which was left open, in order
that the flash might illuminate her apartment; then several large cannon
balls were rolled through the rooms over her head, imitative
<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
of thunder. The person in her room then uttered a horrible groan, and
gliding along by her bed, took his stand behind the curtains, near the
foot. The noises below, the cry of murder, the firing of the second
pistol, and the running up stairs, were all corresponding scenes to
impress terror on her imagination. The pretended ghost then advanced in
front of her bed, while lights were slowly introduced, which first shone
faintly, until they were ushered into the room by the private door, <ins
class = "change" title = "1870 ‘exhibited’">exhibiting</ins> the person
before her in all his horrific appearances. On her shrieking, and
shrinking into the bed, the lights were suddenly extinguished, and the
person, after commanding her to be gone in a hoarse voice, passed again
to the foot of the bed, shook it violently, and made a seeming attempt
to get <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘onto’">upon</ins> it, when,
perceiving her to be springing up, he fled out of the room by the secret
door, cautiously shut it, and joined his companions.</p>

<p>The operators had not yet completed their farce, or rather, to
Melissa, tragedy. They had framed an image of paste-board, in human
shape, arrayed it in black, its eyes being formed of large pieces of
what is vulgarly called <i>fox-fire</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagN"
id = "tagN" href = "#noteN">*</a>
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteN" id = "noteN" href = "#tagN">*</a>
A sort of decayed or rotten wood, which in the night <ins class =
"change" title = "1804/11 ‘appears’">looks</ins> like coals of fire, of
a bright whitish colour. It emits a faint light.</span>
made into the
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
likeness of human eyes, some <ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">of
the same</ins> material being placed in its mouth, around which was a
piece of the <ins class = "correction"
title = "1804/51/70 ‘thinest’">thinnest</ins> scarlet tiffany, in order to make it appear of
a flame colour. They had also constructed a large combustible ball, of
several thicknesses of paste-board, to which a match was placed. The
image was to be conveyed into her room, and placed, in the dark, before
her bed;&mdash;<ins class = "other" title = "1804 only">&amp;
</ins>while in that position, the ball was to be rubbed over with
phosphorus, the match set on fire, and rolled across her chamber, and
when it burst, the image was to vanish, by being suddenly conveyed out
of the private door, which was to close the scene for that night. But as
Melissa had now arisen and <ins class = "change"
title = "1804/11 ‘alighted’">lighted</ins> candles, the plan was defeated.</p>

<p>While they were consulting how to proceed, they heard her unlock her
chamber door, and slowly descend the stairs. Fearing a discovery, they
retired with their lights, and the person who had been in her chamber,
not having <del class = "other" title = "1870 omits">yet</del> stripped
off his ghostly habiliments, laid himself down on one side of the hall.
The man who had the image, crowded himself with it under the stairs she
was descending. On her dropping the candle, when she turned to flee to
her chamber, from the sight of the same object which had appeared at her
bed-side, the person under the stairs presented the
<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
image at their foot, and at the same instant the combustible ball was
prepared, and rolled through the hall; and when on its bursting she
fainted, they began to grow alarmed; but on finding that she recovered
and regained her chamber, they departed, for that time, from the
house.</p>

<p>“Our scheme, continued the wounded man, had the desired effect. On
returning a few evenings after, we found the lady gone and the furniture
removed. Several attempts were afterwards made to occupy the house, but
we always succeeded in soon frightening the inhabitants away.”</p>

<p>Edgar and Alonzo then requested their prisoner to show them the
springs of the secret doors, and how they were opened. The springs were
sunk in the wood, which being touched by entering a <ins class =
"change" title = "1870 ‘gimlet’">gimblet</ins> hole with a piece of
pointed steel, which each of the gang always had about him, the door
would fly open, and fasten again in shutting <ins class = "change" title
= "1870 ‘too’">to</ins>. On opening the trap-door over which the gang
had sat when they first discovered them, they found the table and
chairs, with the decanters broken, and the money, which they secured. In
one part of the cellar they were shown a kind of cave, its mouth covered
with boards and earth&mdash;here the company kept their furniture, and
to this place would they have removed it, had they not been so
<span class = "pagenum">246</span>
suddenly frightened away. The canoe they found secreted in the bushes
beyond the canal.</p>

<hr class = "wide">
<a name = "page246" id = "page246"> </a>

<p>It was then agreed that the man should go before the proper
authorities in a neighbouring town, and there, as state’s evidence, make
affidavit of what he had recited, and as complete a developement of the
characters concerned in the business as possible, when he was to be
released. The man enquired to what town they were to <ins class =
"correction" title = ", invisible">go,</ins> which, when they had
informed him, “Then, said he, it will be in my power to perform one deed
of justice before I leave the country, as leave it I must, immediately
after I have given in my testimony, or I shall be assassinated by some
of those who will be implicated in the transaction I have related.”</p>

<p>He then informed them, that while he, with the gang, was prosecuting
the illicit trade, a&nbsp;British ship came and anchored in the Sound,
which they supplied with provisions, but that having at one time a
considerable quantity on hand, the ship sent its boat on shore, with an
officer and five men, to fetch it; the officer came with them on shore,
leaving the men in the boat: “As we were about to carry the provisions
on board the boat, continued the man, a&nbsp;party of Americans fired
upon us, and
<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
wounded the officer in the thigh, who fell: “I&nbsp;shall be made
prisoner, said he, taking out his purse; keep this, and if I live and
regain my liberty, perhaps you may have an opportunity of restoring
it:&mdash;alarm the boat’s crew, and shift for yourselves.” The boat was
alarmed, returned to the ship, and we saved ourselves by flight.</p>

<p>“This happened about four months ago; the ship soon after sailed for
New York, and the officer was imprisoned in the gaol of the town to
which we are to go; I&nbsp;can therefore restore him his purse.”</p>

<p>The man farther informed them, that they had several times come near
being taken, and the last trip they were fired upon, and one of their
party killed.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "1851 superfluous open quote">They</ins> immediately set out for the aforesaid town, after
having dismissed their fifteen men; and when they arrived there, Alonzo
and Edgar accompanied their prisoner to the gaol. On making the proper
enquiries, they were conducted into a dark and dirty apartment of the
gaol, where were several prisoners in irons. The British officer was
soon distinguished among them by his regimentals. Though enveloped in
filth and dust, his countenance appeared familiar to Alonzo; and on a
few moments recollection, he recognized in the manacled officer, the
generous midshipman,
<span class = "pagenum">248</span>
<ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘John’">Jack</ins> Brown, who had so
disinterestedly relieved him, when he escaped from the prison in
London!</p>

<p>In the fervency of his feelings, Alonzo flew to him and clasped him
in his arms. “What do I behold! he cried. My friend, my brave deliverer,
in chains in my own country!”</p>

<p>“The fortune of war, boy! said Jack&mdash;it might have been worse.
But my lad, I&nbsp;am heartily glad to see you; how has it fared with
you since you left Old England?”&mdash;“We will talk of that by and by,”
said Alonzo.</p>

<p>There were then some American officers of distinction in town, with
whom Edgar was acquainted, to whom he applied for the relief of the
noble sailor;<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>and as there were
several other British prisoners in <ins class = "other"
title = "1804 only">the</ins> gaol it was agreed that a cartel should be immediately
sent to New York to exchange them. Alonzo had, therefore, the
satisfaction to see the irons knocked off of his liberal hearted
benefactor, and his prison doors opened.</p>

<p>The man they had taken at the mansion, returned him his purse,
containing only twenty-five guineas, of which Jack gave him ten. “There,
boy, said he, you have been honest, so I will divide with you.”</p>

<p>They then repaired to an inn. Jack, whose wound was healed, was put
under
<span class = "pagenum">249</span>
the hands of a barber, <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘cleansed’">cleaned</ins>, furnished with a change of clothes, and soon
appeared in a new attitude.</p>

<p>He informed Alonzo, that soon after he left England, his ship was
ordered <ins class = "change" title = "1870 ‘to’">for</ins> America:
that the price of provisions growing high, it had taken almost all his
wages to support his family; that he had sent home his last remittance
just before he was taken, reserving only the twenty-five guineas which
had been restored him that day.&mdash;“But I have never despaired, said
he; the great Commodore of life orders all for the best. My tour of duty
is to serve my king and country, and provide for my dear Poll and her
chicks, which, if I faithfully perform, I&nbsp;shall gain the applause
of the Commander.”</p>

<p>When the cartel was ready to depart, Alonzo, taking Jack apart from
the company, presented him with a draught <ins class = "change" title =
"1870 ‘for’">of</ins> five hundred pounds sterling, on a merchant in New
York, who privately transacted business with the Americans. “Take this,
my friend, said he; you can ensure it by converting it into bills of
exchange on London. Though you once saw me naked, I&nbsp;can now
conveniently spare this sum, and it may assist you in buffeting the
billows of life.”&mdash;The generous tar shed tears of gratitude, and
Alonzo enjoyed the pleasure of seeing
<span class = "pagenum">250</span>
him depart, calling down blessings on the head of his reciprocal
benefactor.</p>

<p>The man who came with Alonzo and Edgar from the mansion, then went
before the <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘magistrate’">magistrates</ins> of the town, and gave his testimony and
affidavit, by which it appeared that several eminent characters of
Connecticut were concerned in this illicit trade. They then released
him, gave him the money they had found in the cellar at the mansion, and
he immediately left the town. Precepts were soon after issued for a
number of those traders; several were taken, among whom were some of the
gang, and others who were only concerned&mdash;but most of them
absconded, so that the company and their plans were broken&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>When Alonzo and Edgar returned home and related their adventure, they
were all surprised at the fortitude of Melissa in being enabled to
support her spirits in a solitary mansion, amidst such great, and so
many terrors.</p>

<p>It was now that Alonzo turned his attention to future prospects. It
was time to select a place for domestic residence. He consulted Melissa,
and she expressively mentioned the little secluded village, where</p>

<p class = "verse">

formerly marked out, with an adjoining farm, was immediately purchased,
and suitable buildings erected, to which Alonzo and Melissa removed the
ensuing summer.</p>

<p>The clergyman of the village having recently died in a <i>good old
age</i>, Edgar was called to the pastoral charge of this unsophisticated
people. Here did Melissa and Alonzo repose after the storms of adversity
were past. Here did they realize all the happiness which the sublunary
hand of time apportions to mortals. <ins class = "change"
title = "1870 ‘Their’">The</ins> varying seasons diversified their joys, except when
Alonzo was called with the militia of his country, wherein he bore an
eminent commission, to oppose the enemy; and this was not unfrequent, as
in his country’s defence he took a very conspicuous part. Then would
anxiety, incertitude, and disconsolation possess the bosom of Melissa,
until dissipated by his safe return. But the happy termination of the
war soon removed all cause of these disquietudes.</p>

<p>Soon after the close of the war, Alonzo received a letter from his
friend, Jack Brown, dated at an interior parish in England,&mdash;in
which, after pouring forth abundance of gratitude, he informed, that on
<span class = "pagenum">252</span>
returning to England he procured his discharge from the navy, sold his
house, and <ins class = "change" title = "1804 ‘moved’">removed</ins>
into the country, where he had set up an inn with the sign of <i>The
Grateful American</i>. “You have made us all happy, said he; my dear
Poll blubbered like a fresh water sailor in a hurricane, when I told her
of your goodness. My wife, my children, all hands upon deck are yours.
We have a good run of business, and are now under full sail, for the
land of prosperity.”</p>

<p>Edgar married to one of the Miss Simpsons, whose father’s seat was in
the vicinity of the village. The parents of Alonzo and Melissa were
their frequent visitors, as were also Vincent and his lady, with many
others of their acquaintance, who all rejoiced in their happy situation,
after such a diversity of troubles. Alfred was generally once a year
their guest, until at length he married and settled in the mercantile
business in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

<p>To our hero and heroine, the rural charms of their secluded village
were a source of ever pleasing variety. Spring, with its <ins class =
"change" title = "1864 ‘verdurous’">verdured</ins> fields, flowery
meads, and vocal groves: its vernal gales, purling rills, and its

<p>Based on references to datable external events (shown here in

<p>[Beauman’s] visits became more and more frequent.</p>
<p>It was summer, and towards evening when [Alonzo] arrived.</p>
<p class = "inset">
To accommodate Beauman’s repeated visits, a full year would have to
pass.</p>

<p>The troubles which gave rise to the disseveration of England from
America had already commenced, which broke out the ensuing spring into
actual hostilities, by <b>the battle of Lexington, followed soon after
by the battle of Bunker Hill</b>.</p>
<p class = "inset">
The battles were in April and June of 1775; “the ensuing spring” would
mean that the year is 1774.</p>

<p>Winter came on; it rapidly passed away. Spring advanced ...</p>
<p class = "inset">
1774 changes to 1775.</p>

<p>The spring opened ... the colonies, which had now been dissevered
from the British empire, by the <b>declaration of independence</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
This is the same spring as in the previous quotation, but if the
Declaration of Independence (July 1776) is in the past, it would have
to be the spring of 1777.</p>

<p>It was at the latter end of the month of May ...</p>
<p class = "inset">
May 1775 or 1777, depending on one’s chosen chronology.</p>

<p>The particulars of <b>this action</b>, in the early stage of the
American war, are yet remembered by many.</p>
<p class = "inset">
The “action” may be a conflation of two different episodes involving the
<i>Trumbull</i>, neither of them early in the war: the first was in June
1780, the second in late August 1781. The <i>Trumbull</i> was towed to
New York, not to London.</p>

Depending on the chronology chosen, Melissa’s reported death could have
been in 1775, 1777 or 1781. Her 18th year is properly the year
<i>leading up to</i> her 18th birthday, but may mean that she was 18
years old.</p>

<h4><a name = "others" id = "others">Other Editions</a></h4>

<p>Within the text, differences between the 1851 and other editions are

<p>Changed words and phrases are <ins class =

</div>

<p>The editions used for comparison were:</p>

<p class = "hanging">
1804<br>
Weekly installments in <i>The Political Barometer</i>, Poughkeepsie,
N.Y.<br>
This version was only available in an online transcription.
A&nbsp;number of questioned words were checked with the transcriber,
Hugh MacDougall of the Cooper Society.</p>
<p class = "hanging">
1811<br>
Plattsburgh, N.Y. “Printed For The Proprietor.”<br>
The first of the pirated editions. Some copies have no author
credit.</p>
<p class = "hanging">
1851<br>
Boston. “Printed for the Publishers.”<br>
Attached to the end, without page break, is a short narrative poem with
prose introduction, “Henry and Julia, a tale of real life” (omitted from
this e-text).</p>
<p class = "hanging">
1864<br>
Philadelphia, Lippincott.<br>
With two exceptions, this is a reprint of the 1851 edition, including
obvious typographical errors and with identical punctuation. There is a
new frontispiece (the 1851 edition had none). The “Henry and Julia” poem
is omitted. Instead, the final page compresses the last two pages (one
full page plus seven lines of text and a four-line footnote) of the 1851
edition into one, using a noticeably smaller font.</p>
<p class = "hanging">
1870?<br>
New York, Leavitt &amp; Allen.<br>
The date is hypothetical, based on librarian’s notation. The book is
probably a reprint of the 1836 Boston edition, which has the same page
count (significantly different from other known editions); 1836 is also
a
plausible date for the frontispiece.</p>


<h5>General Differences</h5>

<p>In the 1804 and 1811 texts, dialogue is usually punctuated as</p>

<p class = "inset">
“To this place (said Melissa) have I taken....“</p>

<p>with some variation between brackets [&nbsp;] and parentheses
(&nbsp;). In the 1870 text, dialogue has “modern” punctuation using
single quotes:</p>

<p class = "inset">
‘To this place,’ said Melissa, ‘have I taken....’</p>

<p>The earlier versions are <i>more</i> likely to use “American”
spellings such as “jail” (but “gaoler”) and “honor”; later editions
(published in the U.S.) use “British” spellings such as “gaol” and
“honour”. The older form “shew” appears only in the earliest
editions.</p>

<p>The spelling “stupify” is used consistently, and “vallies” is almost
universal. The spellings “discreet(ly)” and “discrete(ly)” seem to have
been used inter&shy;changeably. Names in “New” such as “New London” were
generally hyphenated in 1804; later versions have fewer hyphens, but
they never disappear altogether.</p>

<p>The ampersand &amp; appears a few dozen times in the original (1804)
version; in 1811 most were changed to “and”, and in later editions it
survived only in the form “&amp;c.”</p>

<p>The 1804 and 1811 texts use “consolate” for “console” almost
everywhere, and the name is spelled Wyllys, changed in later editions to
Wyllis. The 1811 text consistently uses the spelling “whipperwill”, and
often uses “come” and “become” for “came” and “became”. The 1851 text
often uses non-standard spellings such as “visiter”, “suiter”,
“persuit”. The 1870 text consistently spells “lilly” with two l’s, and
uses “set” for “sit”; it often inter&shy;changes or omits
“the/this/that” and similar.</p>
